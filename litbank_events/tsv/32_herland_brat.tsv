Terry	O

His	O

was	O

He	O
used	O

was	O
a	O

one	O

for	O

those	O

Jeff	O
could	O
beat	O
him	O

I	O
did	O

what	O
it	O
was	O

talked	O
about	O

so	O

We	O
three	O
had	O
a	O
chance	O
to	O
join	O
a	O
big	O
scientific	O
expedition	O
.	O

They	O
needed	O
a	O
doctor	O

and	O
that	O
gave	O
Jeff	O
an	O
excuse	EVENT
for	O
dropping	EVENT
his	O
just	O

they	O
needed	O

for	O

I	O
got	O

The	O
expedition	EVENT
was	O
up	O
among	O
the	O

enormous	O
hinterland	O
of	O
a	O
great	O
river	O

and	O
all	O

But	O
this	O

That	O
was	O
only	O
the	O
merest	O
starter	O
for	O

My	O
interest	EVENT
was	O
first	O
roused	O
by	O
talk	O
among	O
our	O

I	O
’m	O
quick	O
at	O

What	O
with	O
that	O

their	O

there	O

It	O
was	O

I	O
fancy	O
the	O

could	O

it	O

There	O
was	O
a	O

Our	O

This	O

we	O

skirted	EVENT

the	O

presently	O
we	O
turned	EVENT

corner	O
