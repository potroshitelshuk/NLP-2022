the	O
increase	O
of	O
mulattoes	O
has	O
been	O
very	O
great	O

Society	O
does	O
not	O
frown	O
upon	O
the	O
man	O
who	O
sits	O
with	O
his	O

upon	O

not	O
amount	O
to	O
more	O
than	O
one	O
in	O
four	O
of	O
the	O
slave	O
population	O
.	O

This	O
fact	O
is	O
of	O
itself	O
the	O
best	O
evidence	O
of	O
the	O
degraded	O
and	O
immoral	O
condition	O
of	O
the	O
relation	O
of	O
master	O
and	O
slave	O
.	O

Throughout	O
the	O
Southern	O
States	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
class	O
of	O
slaves	O
who	O
,	O
in	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
towns	O
,	O
are	O
permitted	O
to	O
hire	O
their	O
time	O
from	O
their	O
owners	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
are	O
always	O
expected	O
to	O
pay	O
a	O
high	O
price	O
.	O

This	O
class	O
is	O
the	O
mulatto	O
women	O
,	O
distinguished	O
for	O
their	O
fascinating	O
beauty	O

The	O
handsomest	O
of	O
these	O
usually	O
pay	O
the	O
greatest	O
amount	O
for	O
their	O
time	O

Many	O
of	O
these	O
women	O
are	O
the	O
favorites	O
of	O
men	O
of	O
property	O
and	O
standing	O
,	O
who	O
furnish	O
them	O
with	O
the	O
means	O
of	O
compensating	O
their	O
owners	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
a	O
few	O
are	O
dressed	O
in	O
the	O
most	O
extravagant	O
manner	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
take	O
into	O
consideration	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
no	O
safeguard	O
is	O
thrown	O
around	O
virtue	O
,	O
and	O
no	O
inducement	O
held	O
out	O
to	O
slave-women	O
to	O
be	O
pure	O
and	O
chaste	O
,	O
we	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
surprised	O
when	O
told	O
that	O
immorality	O
and	O

pervade	O
the	O
cities	O

towns	O
of	O
the	O
South	O
to	O
an	O
extent	O
unknown	O
in	O
the	O
Northern	O

Indeed	O
,	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
slave-women	O
have	O
no	O
higher	O
aspiration	O
than	O
that	O
of	O
becoming	O
the	O
finely-dressed	O
mistress	O
of	O

At	O
