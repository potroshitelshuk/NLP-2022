Washing	O
the	O
face	O

Being	O
always	O
wide-awake	O
and	O
ready	O
for	O
business	O
,	O
he	O
earned	O
enough	O
to	O
have	O
supported	O
him	O
comfortably	O
and	O
respectably	O
.	O

There	O
were	O
not	O
a	O
few	O
young	O
clerks	O
who	O
employed	O
Dick	O
from	O
time	O
to	O
time	O
in	O
his	O
professional	O
capacity	O
,	O
who	O
scarcely	O
earned	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
he	O
,	O
greatly	O
as	O
their	O
style	O
and	O
dress	O
exceeded	O
his	O
.	O

But	O
Dick	O
was	O
careless	O
of	O
his	O
earnings	O
.	O

Where	O
they	O
went	O
he	O
could	O
hardly	O
have	O
told	O
himself	O
.	O

However	O
much	O
he	O
managed	O
to	O
earn	O
during	O
the	O
day	O
,	O
all	O
was	O
generally	O
spent	O
before	O
morning	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
fond	O
of	O
going	O
to	O
the	O
Old	O
Bowery	O
Theatre	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
Tony	O
Pastor	O
's	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
any	O
money	O
left	O
afterwards	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
invite	O
some	O
of	O
his	O
friends	O
in	O
somewhere	O
to	O
have	O
an	O
oyster-stew	O
;	O
so	O
it	O
seldom	O
happened	O
that	O
he	O
commenced	O
the	O
day	O
with	O
a	O
penny	O
.	O

Then	O
I	O
am	O
sorry	O
to	O
add	O
that	O
Dick	O
had	O
formed	O
the	O
habit	O
of	O
smoking	O
.	O

This	O
cost	O
him	O
considerable	O
,	O
for	O
Dick	O
was	O
rather	O
fastidious	O
about	O
his	O
cigars	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
n't	O
smoke	O
the	O
cheapest	O
.	O

Besides	O
,	O
having	O
a	O
liberal	O
nature	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
generally	O
ready	O
to	O
treat	O
his	O
companions	O
.	O

But	O
of	O
course	O
the	O
expense	O
was	O
the	O
smallest	O
objection	O
.	O

No	O
boy	O
of	O
fourteen	O
can	O
smoke	O
without	O
being	O
affected	O
injuriously	O
.	O

Men	O
are	O
frequently	O
injured	O
by	O
smoking	O
,	O
and	O
boys	O
always	O
.	O

But	O
large	O
numbers	O
of	O
the	O
newsboys	O
and	O
boot-blacks	O
form	O
the	O
habit	O
.	O

Exposed	O
to	O
the	O
cold	O
and	O
wet	O
they	O
find	O
that	O
it	O
warms	O
them	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
self-indulgence	O
grows	O
upon	O
them	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
not	O
uncommon	O
to	O
see	O
a	O
little	O
boy	O
,	O
too	O
young	O
to	O
be	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
mother	O
's	O
sight	O
,	O
smoking	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
apparent	O
satisfaction	O
of	O
a	O
veteran	O
smoker	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
another	O
way	O
in	O
which	O
Dick	O
sometimes	O
lost	O
money	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
noted	O
gambling-house	O
on	O
Baxter	O
Street	O
,	O
which	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
was	O
sometimes	O
crowded	O
with	O
these	O
juvenile	O
gamesters	O
,	O
who	O
staked	O
their	O
hard	O
earnings	O
,	O
generally	O
losing	O
of	O
course	O
,	O
and	O
refreshing	O
themselves	O
from	O
time	O
to	O
time	O
with	O
a	O
vile	O
mixture	O
of	O
liquor	O
at	O
two	O
cents	O
a	O
glass	O
.	O

Sometimes	O
Dick	O
strayed	O
in	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
played	O
with	O
the	O
rest	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
mentioned	EVENT
Dick	O
's	O
faults	O
and	O
defects	O
,	O
because	O
I	O
want	O
it	O
understood	O
,	O
to	O
begin	O
with	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
consider	O
him	O
a	O
model	O
boy	O
.	O

But	O
there	O
were	O
some	O
good	O
points	O
about	O
him	O
nevertheless	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
above	O
doing	O
anything	O
mean	O
or	O
dishonorable	O
.	O

He	O
would	O
not	O
steal	O
,	O
or	O
cheat	O
,	O
or	O
impose	O
upon	O
younger	O
boys	O
,	O
but	O
was	O
frank	O
and	O
straight-forward	O
,	O
manly	O
and	O
self-reliant	O
.	O

His	O
nature	O
was	O
a	O
noble	O
one	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
saved	O
him	O
from	O
all	O
mean	O
faults	O
.	O

I	O
hope	O
my	O
young	O
readers	O
will	O
like	O
him	O
as	O
I	O
do	O
,	O
without	O
being	O
blind	O
to	O
his	O
faults	O
.	O

Perhaps	O
,	O
although	O
he	O
was	O
only	O
a	O
boot-black	O
,	O
they	O
may	O
find	O
something	O
in	O
him	O
to	O
imitate	O
.	O
