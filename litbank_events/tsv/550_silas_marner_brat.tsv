CHAPTER	O
I	O
In	O
the	O
days	O
when	O
the	O
spinning-wheels	O
hummed	O
busily	O
in	O
the	O
farmhouses	O
--	O
and	O
even	O
great	O
ladies	O
,	O
clothed	O
in	O
silk	O
and	O
thread-lace	O
,	O
had	O
their	O
toy	O
spinning-wheels	O
of	O
polished	O
oak	O
--	O
there	O
might	O
be	O
seen	O
in	O
districts	O
far	O
away	O
among	O
the	O
lanes	O
,	O
or	O
deep	O
in	O
the	O
bosom	O
of	O
the	O
hills	O
,	O
certain	O
pallid	O
undersized	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
brawny	O
country-folk	O
,	O
looked	O
like	O
the	O
remnants	O
of	O
a	O
disinherited	O
race	O
.	O

The	O
shepherd	O
's	O
dog	O
barked	O
fiercely	O
when	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
alien-looking	O
men	O
appeared	O
on	O
the	O
upland	O
,	O
dark	O
against	O
the	O
early	O
winter	O
sunset	O
;	O
for	O
what	O

a	O
figure	O
bent	O
under	O
a	O
heavy	O
bag	O
?	O

--	O
and	O
these	O
pale	O
men	O
rarely	O
stirred	O
abroad	O
without	O
that	O
mysterious	O
burden	O
.	O

The	O
shepherd	O
himself	O
,	O
though	O
he	O
had	O
good	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
that	O
the	O
bag	O
held	O
nothing	O
but	O
flaxen	O
thread	O
,	O
or	O
else	O
the	O
long	O
rolls	O
of	O
strong	O
linen	O
spun	O
from	O
that	O
thread	O
,	O
was	O
not	O
quite	O
sure	O
that	O
this	O
trade	O
of	O
weaving	O
,	O
indispensable	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
could	O
be	O
carried	O
on	O
entirely	O
without	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
the	O
Evil	O
One	O

In	O
that	O
far-off	O
time	O
superstition	O
clung	O
easily	O
round	O
every	O
person	O
or	O
thing	O
that	O
was	O
at	O
all	O
unwonted	O
,	O
or	O
even	O
intermittent	O
and	O
occasional	O
merely	O
,	O
like	O
the	O
visits	O
of	O
the	O
pedlar	O
or	O
the	O
knife-grinder	O
.	O

No	O
one	O
knew	O
where	O
wandering	O
men	O
had	O
their	O
homes	O
or	O
their	O
origin	O
;	O
and	O
how	O
was	O
a	O
man	O
to	O
be	O
explained	O
unless	O
you	O
at	O

somebody	O
who	O

peasants	O
of	O
old	O
times	O
,	O
the	O
world	O
outside	O
their	O
own	O

experience	O
was	O
a	O
region	O
of	O
vagueness	O
and	O
mystery	O
:	O
to	O
their	O
untravelled	O
thought	O
a	O
state	O
of	O
wandering	O
was	O
a	O
conception	O
as	O
dim	O
as	O
the	O
winter	O
life	O
of	O
the	O

that	O
came	O

a	O
settler	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
came	O
from	O
distant	O
parts	O
,	O
hardly	O
ever	O
ceased	O
to	O
be	O
viewed	O
with	O
a	O
remnant	O
of	O
distrust	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
have	O
prevented	O
any	O
surprise	O
if	O
a	O
long	O
course	O
of	O
inoffensive	O
conduct	O
on	O
his	O

in	O

in	O
some	O

wholly	O
hidden	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
partook	O
of	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
conjuring	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
way	O
it	O
came	O
to	O
pass	O
that	O
those	O
scattered	O
linen-weavers	O
--	O
emigrants	O
from	O
the	O
town	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
--	O
were	O
to	O
the	O
last	O
regarded	O
as	O
aliens	O
by	O
their	O
rustic	O
neighbours	O
,	O
and	O
usually	O
contracted	O
the	O
eccentric	O
habits	O
which	O
belong	O
to	O
a	O
state	O
of	O
loneliness	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
early	O
years	O
of	O
this	O
century	O
,	O
such	O
a	O
linen-weaver	O
,	O
named	O
Silas	O
Marner	O
,	O
worked	O
at	O
his	O
vocation	O
in	O
a	O
stone	O
cottage	O
that	O
stood	O
among	O
the	O
nutty	O
hedgerows	O
near	O
the	O
village	O
of	O
Raveloe	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
far	O
from	O
the	O
edge	O
of	O
a	O
deserted	O
stone-pit	O
.	O

The	O
questionable	O
sound	O
of	O
Silas	O
's	O
loom	O
,	O
so	O
unlike	O
the	O
natural	O
cheerful	O
trotting	O
of	O
the	O
winnowing-machine	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
simpler	O
rhythm	O
of	O
the	O
flail	O
,	O
had	O
a	O
half-fearful	O
fascination	O
for	O
the	O
Raveloe	O
boys	O
,	O
who	O
would	O
often	O
leave	O
off	O
their	O
nutting	O
or	O
birds	O
'	O
-	O
nesting	O
to	O
peep	O
in	O
at	O
the	O
window	O
of	O
the	O
stone	O
cottage	O
,	O
counterbalancing	O
a	O
certain	O
awe	O
at	O
the	O
mysterious	O
action	O
of	O
the	O
loom	O
,	O
by	O
a	O
pleasant	O
sense	O
of	O
scornful	O
superiority	O
,	O
drawn	O
from	O
the	O
mockery	O
of	O
its	O
alternating	O
noises	O
,	O
along	O
with	O
the	O
bent	O
,	O
tread-mill	O
attitude	O
of	O
the	O
weaver	O
.	O

But	O
sometimes	O
it	O
happened	O
that	O
Marner	O
,	O
pausing	O
to	O
adjust	O
an	O
irregularity	O
in	O
his	O
thread	O
,	O
became	O
aware	O
of	O
the	O
small	O
scoundrels	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
though	O
chary	O
of	O
his	O
time	O
,	O
he	O
liked	O
their	O
intrusion	O
so	O
ill	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
descend	O
from	O
his	O
loom	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
opening	O
the	O
door	O
,	O
would	O
fix	O
on	O
them	O
a	O
gaze	O
that	O
was	O
always	O
enough	O
to	O
make	O
them	O
take	O
to	O
their	O
legs	O
in	O
terror	O
.	O

For	O
how	O
was	O
it	O
possible	O
to	O
believe	O
that	O
those	O
large	O
brown	O
protuberant	O
eyes	O
in	O
Silas	O
Marner	O
's	O
pale	O
face	O
really	O
saw	O
nothing	O
very	O
distinctly	O
that	O
was	O
not	O
close	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
rather	O
that	O
their	O
dreadful	O
stare	O
could	O
dart	O
cramp	O
,	O
or	O
rickets	O
,	O
or	O
a	O
wry	O
mouth	O
at	O
any	O
boy	O
who	O
happened	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
the	O
rear	O
?	O

They	O
had	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
heard	O
their	O
fathers	O
and	O
mothers	O
hint	O
that	O
Silas	O
Marner	O
could	O
cure	O
folks	O
'	O
rheumatism	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
a	O
mind	O
,	O
and	O
add	O
,	O
still	O
more	O
darkly	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
you	O
could	O
only	O
speak	O
the	O
devil	O
fair	O
enough	O
,	O
he	O
might	O
save	O
you	O
the	O
cost	O
of	O
the	O
doctor	O
.	O

Such	O
strange	O
lingering	O
echoes	O
of	O
the	O
old	O
demon-worship	O
might	O
perhaps	O
even	O
now	O
be	O
caught	O
by	O
the	O
diligent	O

among	O

grey-haired	O
