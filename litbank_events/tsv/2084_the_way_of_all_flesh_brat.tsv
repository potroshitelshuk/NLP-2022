CHAPTER	O
I	O
When	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
small	O
boy	O
at	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
the	O
century	O
I	O
remember	O
an	O
old	O
man	O
who	O
wore	O
knee-breeches	O
and	O
worsted	O
stockings	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
used	O
to	O
hobble	O
about	O
the	O
street	O
of	O
our	O
village	O
with	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
a	O
stick	O
.	O

He	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
getting	O
on	O
for	O
eighty	O
in	O
the	O
year	O
1807	O
,	O
earlier	O
than	O
which	O
date	O
I	O
suppose	O
I	O
can	O
hardly	O
remember	O
him	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
was	O
born	O
in	O
1802	O
.	O

A	O
few	O
white	O
locks	O
hung	O
about	O
his	O
ears	O
,	O
his	O
shoulders	O
were	O
bent	O
and	O
his	O
knees	O
feeble	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
was	O
still	O
hale	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
much	O
respected	O
in	O
our	O
little	O
world	O
of	O
Paleham	O
.	O

His	O
name	O
was	O
Pontifex	O
.	O

His	O
wife	O
was	O
said	O
to	O
be	O
his	O
master	O
;	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
told	O
she	O
brought	O
him	O
a	O
little	O
money	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
can	O
not	O
have	O
been	O
much	O
.	O

She	O
was	O
a	O
tall	O
,	O
square-shouldered	O
person	O
(	O
I	O
have	O
heard	O
my	O
father	O
call	O
her	O
a	O
Gothic	O
woman	O
)	O
who	O
had	O
insisted	O
on	O
being	O
married	O
to	O
Mr	O
Pontifex	O
when	O
he	O
was	O
young	O
and	O
too	O
good-natured	O
to	O
say	O
nay	O
to	O
any	O
woman	O
who	O
wooed	O
him	O
.	O

The	O
pair	O
had	O
lived	O
not	O
unhappily	O
together	O
,	O
for	O
Mr	O
Pontifex	O
's	O
temper	O
was	O
easy	O
and	O
he	O
soon	O
learned	O
to	O
bow	O
before	O
his	O
wife	O
's	O
more	O
stormy	O
moods	O
.	O

Mr	O
Pontifex	O
was	O
a	O
carpenter	O
by	O
trade	O
;	O
he	O
was	O
also	O
at	O
one	O
time	O
parish	O
clerk	O
;	O
when	O
I	O
remember	O
him	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
so	O
far	O
risen	O
in	O
life	O
as	O
to	O
be	O
no	O
longer	O
compelled	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
his	O
own	O
hands	O
.	O

In	O
his	O
earlier	O
days	O
he	O
had	O
taught	O
himself	O
to	O
draw	O
.	O

I	O
do	O
not	O
say	O
he	O
drew	O
well	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
surprising	O
he	O
should	O
draw	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
he	O
did	O
.	O

My	O
father	O
,	O
who	O
took	EVENT
the	O
living	O
of	O
Paleham	O
about	O
the	O
year	O
1797	O
,	O
became	O
possessed	O
of	O
a	O
good	O
many	O
of	O
old	O
Mr	O
Pontifex	O
's	O
drawings	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
always	O
of	O
local	O
subjects	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
unaffectedly	O
painstaking	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
have	O
passed	O
for	O
the	O
work	O
of	O
some	O
good	O
early	O
master	O
.	O

I	O
remember	O
them	O
as	O
hanging	O
up	O
framed	O
and	O
glazed	O
in	O
the	O
study	O
at	O
the	O
Rectory	O
,	O
and	O
tinted	O
,	O
as	O
all	O
else	O
in	O
the	O
room	O
was	O
tinted	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
green	O
reflected	O
from	O
the	O
fringe	O
of	O
ivy	O
leaves	O
that	O
grew	O
around	O
the	O
windows	O
.	O

I	O
wonder	EVENT
how	O
they	O
will	O
actually	O
cease	O
and	O
come	O
to	O
an	O
end	O
as	O
drawings	O
,	O
and	O
into	O
what	O
new	O
phases	O
of	O
being	O
they	O
will	O
then	O
enter	O
.	O

Not	O
content	O
with	O
being	O
an	O
artist	O
,	O
Mr	O
Pontifex	O
must	O
needs	O
also	O
be	O
a	O
musician	O
.	O

He	O
built	O
the	O
organ	O
in	O
the	O
church	O
with	O
his	O
own	O
hands	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
a	O
smaller	O
one	O
which	O
he	O
kept	O
in	O
his	O
own	O
house	O
.	O

He	O
could	O
play	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
he	O
could	O
draw	O
,	O
not	O
very	O
well	O
according	O
to	O
professional	O
standards	O
,	O
but	O
much	O
better	O
than	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
expected	O
.	O

I	O
myself	O
showed	O
a	O
taste	O
for	O
music	O
at	O
an	O
early	O
age	O
,	O
and	O

Mr	O
Pontifex	O
on	O
finding	EVENT

,	O
as	O
he	O

did	O
,	O
became	O
partial	EVENT
to	O
me	O
in	O

.	O

It	O
may	O
be	O
thought	O
that	O
with	O
so	O
many	O
irons	O
in	O
the	O
fire	O
he	O
could	O
hardly	O
be	O
a	O
very	O
thriving	O
man	O
,	O
but	O
this	O
was	O
not	O
the	O
case	O
.	O

His	O
father	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
day	O
labourer	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
had	O
himself	O
begun	EVENT

with	O
no	O
other	O

his	O
good	O
sense	O
and	O
good	O
constitution	O
;	O
now	O

however	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
goodly	O
show	O
of	O

yard	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
look	O
of	O
solid	O

over	O
his	O

Towards	O
the	O
close	O
of	O
the	O
eighteenth	O
century	O
and	O
not	O
long	O
before	O
my	O
father	O
came	EVENT
to	O
Paleham	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
taken	EVENT
a	O

of	O
about	O
ninety	O

thus	O
making	O
a	O
considerable	O
rise	O

Along	O

the	O

went	O

old-fashioned	O

with	O
a	O
