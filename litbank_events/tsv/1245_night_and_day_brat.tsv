CHAPTER	O
I	O
It	O
was	O
a	O
Sunday	O
evening	O
in	O
October	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
common	O
with	O
many	O
other	O
young	O
ladies	O
of	O
her	O
class	O
,	O
Katharine	O
Hilbery	O
was	O
pouring	EVENT
out	O
tea	O
.	O

Perhaps	O
a	O
fifth	O
part	O
of	O
her	O
mind	O
was	O
thus	O
occupied	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
remaining	O
parts	O
leapt	EVENT
over	O
the	O
little	O
barrier	O
of	O
day	O
which	O
interposed	O
between	O
Monday	O
morning	O
and	O
this	O
rather	O
subdued	O
moment	O
,	O
and	O
played	EVENT
with	O
the	O
things	O
one	O
does	O
voluntarily	O
and	O
normally	O
in	O
the	O
daylight	O
.	O

But	O
although	O
she	O
was	O
silent	O
,	O
she	O
was	O
evidently	O
mistress	O
of	O
a	O
situation	O
which	O
was	O
familiar	O
enough	O
to	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
inclined	O
to	O
let	O
it	O
take	O
its	O
way	O
for	O
the	O
six	O
hundredth	O
time	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
without	O
bringing	O
into	O
play	O
any	O
of	O
her	O
unoccupied	O
faculties	O
.	O

A	O
single	O
glance	O
was	O
enough	O
to	O
show	O
that	O
Mrs.	O
Hilbery	O
was	O
so	O
rich	O
in	O
the	O
gifts	O
which	O
make	O
tea-parties	O
of	O
elderly	O
distinguished	O
people	O
successful	O
,	O
that	O
she	O
scarcely	O
needed	O
any	O
help	O
from	O
her	O
daughter	O
,	O
provided	O
that	O
the	O
tiresome	O
business	O
of	O
teacups	O
and	O
bread	O
and	O
butter	O
was	O
discharged	O
for	O
her	O
.	O

Considering	O
that	O
the	O
little	O
party	O
had	O
been	O
seated	O
round	O
the	O
tea-table	O
for	O
less	O
than	O
twenty	O
minutes	O
,	O
the	O
animation	O
observable	O
on	O
their	O
faces	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O
sound	EVENT
they	O
were	O
producing	O
collectively	O
,	O
were	O
very	O
creditable	O
to	O
the	O
hostess	O
.	O

It	O
suddenly	O
came	EVENT
into	O
Katharine	O
’s	O
mind	O
that	O
if	O
some	O
one	O
opened	O
the	O
door	O
at	O
this	O
moment	O
he	O
would	O
think	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
enjoying	O
themselves	O
;	O
he	O
would	O
think	O
,	O
“	O
What	O
an	O
extremely	O
nice	O
house	O
to	O
come	O
into	O
!	O
”	O

and	O
instinctively	O
she	O
laughed	EVENT
,	O
and	O
said	EVENT
something	O
to	O
increase	EVENT
the	O
noise	EVENT
,	O
for	O
the	O
credit	O
of	O
the	O
house	O
presumably	O
,	O
since	O
she	O
herself	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
feeling	O
exhilarated	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
very	O
same	O
moment	O
,	O
rather	O
to	O
her	O
amusement	EVENT
,	O
the	O
door	O
was	O
flung	EVENT
open	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
young	O
man	O
entered	EVENT
the	O
room	O
.	O

Katharine	O
,	O
as	O
she	O
shook	EVENT
hands	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
asked	EVENT
him	O
,	O
in	O
her	O
own	O
mind	O
,	O
“	O
Now	O

you	O

enormously	O

...	O
“	O
Mr.	O
Denham	O
,	O
mother	O

”	O
she	O
said	EVENT
aloud	O
,	O
for	O
she	O
saw	EVENT
that	O
her	O
mother	O
had	O
forgotten	O
his	O
name	O

That	O
fact	O
was	O
perceptible	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Denham	O
also	O
,	O
and	O
increased	EVENT
the	O
awkwardness	EVENT
which	O
inevitably	O
attends	O
the	O
entrance	O
of	O

into	O
a	O

full	O
of	O
people	O
much	O
at	O
their	O

all	O
launched	O
upon	O

At	O
the	O

time	O

it	O
seemed	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Denham	O
as	O
if	O
a	O
thousand	O

closed	O
between	O

along	O

in	O

out	O

this	O

seemed	O
very	O
remote	O

still	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
faces	O
of	O
the	O

people	O
were	O
mellowed	O

at	O
some	O
distance	O
from	O
each	O
other	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
bloom	O
on	O
them	O
owing	O
to	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
air	O
in	O
the	O

Mr.	O

had	O
come	EVENT
in	O
as	O
Mr.	O

the	O

He	O
kept	O
this	O
suspended	EVENT
while	O
the	O

sat	EVENT
down	O

and	O
Mrs.	O
Hilbery	O
deftly	O
joined	EVENT
the	O

by	O
leaning	EVENT
towards	O
him	O
and	O
remarking	EVENT

“	O

Katharine	O
explained	EVENT

Mr.	O
Denham	O
muttered	EVENT
something	O

which	O
was	O
indeed	O
all	O
that	O
was	O
required	O
of	O
him	O

and	O
the	O

went	EVENT
on	O
where	O
he	O
had	O

off	O

Privately	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Denham	O
cursed	EVENT
himself	O
very	O
sharply	O
for	O

exchanged	EVENT
the	O
freedom	O

he	O
certainly	O

that	O
Mr.	O

“	O

Katharine	O
stirred	EVENT
her	O
tea	O

and	O
seemed	O
to	O
speculate	O

so	O
Denham	O
thought	EVENT

upon	O
the	O
duty	O
of	O
filling	O
somebody	O

cup	O

she	O
was	O
really	O
wondering	EVENT

she	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
keep	O
this	O
strange	O
young	O
man	O
in	O
harmony	O
with	O
the	O
rest	O

She	O
observed	EVENT
that	O
he	O
was	O

so	O
that	O

was	O
danger	EVENT

could	O
