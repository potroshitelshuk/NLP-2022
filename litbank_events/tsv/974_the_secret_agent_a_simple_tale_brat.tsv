CHAPTER	O
I	O
Mr	O
Verloc	O
,	O
going	O
out	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
left	O
his	O
shop	O
nominally	O
in	O
charge	O
of	O
his	O
brother-in-law	O
.	O

It	O
could	O
be	O
done	O
,	O
because	O
there	O
was	O
very	O
little	O
business	O
at	O
any	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
practically	O
none	O
at	O
all	O
before	O
the	O
evening	O
.	O

Mr	O
Verloc	O
cared	O
but	O
little	O
about	O
his	O
ostensible	O
business	O
.	O

And	O
,	O
moreover	O
,	O
his	O
wife	O
was	O
in	O
charge	O
of	O
his	O
brother-in-law	O
.	O

The	O
shop	O
was	O
small	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
was	O
the	O
house	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
grimy	O
brick	O
houses	O
which	O
existed	O
in	O
large	O
quantities	O
before	O
the	O
era	O
of	O
reconstruction	O
dawned	O
upon	O
London	O
.	O

The	O
shop	O
was	O
a	O
square	O
box	O
of	O
a	O
place	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
front	O
glazed	O
in	O
small	O
panes	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
daytime	O
the	O
door	O
remained	O
closed	O
;	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
it	O
stood	O
discreetly	O
but	O
suspiciously	O
ajar	O
.	O

The	O
window	O
contained	O
photographs	O
of	O
more	O
or	O
less	O
undressed	O
dancing	O
girls	O
;	O
nondescript	O
packages	O
in	O
wrappers	O
like	O
patent	O
medicines	O
;	O
closed	O
yellow	O
paper	O
envelopes	O
,	O
very	O
flimsy	O
,	O
and	O
marked	O
two-and-six	O
in	O
heavy	O
black	O
figures	O
;	O
a	O
few	O
numbers	O
of	O
ancient	O
French	O
comic	O
publications	O
hung	O
across	O
a	O
string	O
as	O
if	O
to	O
dry	O
;	O
a	O
dingy	O
blue	O
china	O
bowl	O
,	O
a	O
casket	O
of	O
black	O
wood	O
,	O
bottles	O
of	O
marking	O
ink	O
,	O
and	O
rubber	O
stamps	O
;	O
a	O
few	O
books	O
,	O
with	O
titles	O
hinting	O
at	O
impropriety	O
;	O
a	O
few	O
apparently	O
old	O
copies	O
of	O
obscure	O
newspapers	O
,	O
badly	O
printed	O
,	O
with	O
titles	O
like	O
_	O
The	O
Torch	O
_	O
,	O
_	O
The	O
Gong	O
_	O
—	O
rousing	O
titles	O
.	O

And	O
the	O
two	O
gas	O
jets	O
inside	O
the	O
panes	O
were	O
always	O
turned	O
low	O
,	O
either	O
for	O
economy	O
’s	O
sake	O
or	O
for	O
the	O
sake	O
of	O
the	O
customers	O
.	O

These	O
customers	O
were	O
either	O
very	O
young	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
hung	O
about	O
the	O
window	O
for	O
a	O
time	O
before	O
slipping	O
in	O
suddenly	O
;	O
or	O
men	O
of	O
a	O
more	O
mature	O
age	O
,	O
but	O
looking	O
generally	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
in	O
funds	O
.	O

Some	O
of	O
that	O
last	O
kind	O
had	O
the	O
collars	O
of	O
their	O
overcoats	O
turned	O
right	O
up	O
to	O
their	O
moustaches	O
,	O
and	O
traces	O
of	O
mud	O
on	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
their	O
nether	O
garments	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
the	O
appearance	O
of	O
being	O
much	O
worn	O
and	O
not	O
very	O
valuable	O
.	O

And	O
the	O
legs	O
inside	O
them	O
did	O
not	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
general	O
rule	O
,	O
seem	O
of	O
much	O
account	O
either	O
.	O

With	O
their	O
hands	O
plunged	O
deep	O
in	O
the	O
side	O
pockets	O
of	O
their	O
coats	O
,	O
they	O
dodged	O
in	O
sideways	O
,	O
one	O
shoulder	O
first	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
afraid	O
to	O
start	O
the	O
bell	O
going	O
.	O

The	O
bell	O
,	O
hung	O
on	O
the	O
door	O
by	O
means	O
of	O
a	O
curved	O
ribbon	O
of	O
steel	O
,	O
was	O
difficult	O
to	O
circumvent	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
hopelessly	O
cracked	O
;	O
but	O
of	O
an	O
evening	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
slightest	O
provocation	O
,	O
it	O
clattered	O
behind	O
the	O
customer	O
with	O
impudent	O
virulence	O
.	O

It	O
clattered	O
;	O
and	O
at	O
that	O
signal	O
,	O
through	O
the	O
dusty	O
glass	O
door	O
behind	O
the	O
painted	O
deal	O
counter	O
,	O
Mr	O
Verloc	O
would	O
issue	O
hastily	O
from	O
the	O
parlour	O
at	O
the	O
back	O
.	O

His	O
eyes	O
were	O
naturally	O
heavy	O
;	O
he	O
had	O
an	O
air	O
of	O
having	O
wallowed	O
,	O
fully	O
dressed	O
,	O
all	O
day	O
on	O
an	O
unmade	O
bed	O
.	O

Another	O
man	O
would	O
have	O
felt	O
such	O
an	O
appearance	O
a	O
distinct	O
disadvantage	O
.	O

In	O
a	O
commercial	O
transaction	O
of	O
the	O
retail	O
order	O
much	O
depends	O
on	O
the	O
seller	O
’s	O
engaging	O
and	O
amiable	O
aspect	O
.	O

But	O
Mr	O
Verloc	O
knew	O
his	O
business	O
,	O
and	O
remained	O
undisturbed	O
by	O
any	O
sort	O
of	O
æsthetic	O
doubt	O
about	O
his	O
appearance	O
.	O

With	O
a	O
firm	O
,	O
steady-eyed	O
impudence	O
,	O
which	O
seemed	O
to	O
hold	O
back	O
the	O
threat	O
of	O
some	O
abominable	O
menace	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
proceed	O
to	O
sell	O
over	O
the	O
counter	O
some	O
object	O
looking	O
obviously	O
and	O
scandalously	O
not	O
worth	O
the	O
money	O
which	O
passed	O
in	O
the	O
transaction	O
:	O
a	O
small	O
cardboard	O
box	O
with	O
apparently	O
nothing	O
inside	O
,	O
for	O
instance	O
,	O
or	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
carefully	O
closed	O
yellow	O
flimsy	O
envelopes	O
,	O
or	O
a	O
soiled	O
volume	O
in	O
paper	O
covers	O
with	O
a	O
promising	O
title	O
.	O

Now	O
and	O
then	O
it	O
happened	O
that	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
faded	O
,	O
yellow	O
dancing	O
girls	O
would	O
get	O
sold	O
to	O
an	O
amateur	O
,	O
as	O
though	O
she	O
had	O
been	O
alive	O
and	O
young	O
.	O

Sometimes	O
it	O
was	O
Mrs	O
Verloc	O
who	O
would	O
appear	O
at	O
the	O
call	O
of	O
the	O
cracked	O
bell	O
.	O

Winnie	O
Verloc	O
was	O
a	O
young	O
woman	O
with	O
a	O
full	O
bust	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
tight	O
bodice	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
broad	O
hips	O
.	O

Her	O
hair	O
was	O
very	O
tidy	O
.	O

Steady-eyed	O
like	O
her	O
husband	O
,	O
she	O
preserved	O
an	O
air	O
of	O
unfathomable	O
indifference	O
behind	O
the	O
rampart	O
of	O
the	O
counter	O
.	O

Then	O
the	O
customer	O
of	O
comparatively	O
tender	O
years	O
would	O
get	O
suddenly	O
disconcerted	O
at	O
having	O
to	O
deal	O
with	O
a	O
woman	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
rage	O
in	O
his	O
heart	O
would	O
proffer	O
a	O
request	O
for	O
a	O
bottle	O
of	O
marking	O
ink	O
,	O
retail	O
value	O
sixpence	O
(	O
price	O
in	O
Verloc	O
’s	O
shop	O
one-and-sixpence	O
)	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
once	O
outside	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
drop	O
stealthily	O
into	O
the	O
gutter	O
.	O

The	O
evening	O
visitors	O
—	O
the	O
men	O
with	O
collars	O
turned	O
up	O
and	O
soft	O
hats	O
rammed	O
down	O
—	O
nodded	O
familiarly	O
to	O
Mrs	O
Verloc	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
a	O
muttered	O
greeting	O
,	O
lifted	O
up	O
the	O
flap	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
counter	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
pass	O
into	O
the	O
back	O
parlour	O
,	O
which	O
gave	O
access	O
to	O
a	O
passage	O
and	O
to	O
a	O
steep	O
flight	O
of	O
stairs	O
.	O

The	O
door	O
of	O
the	O
shop	O
was	O
the	O
only	O
means	O
of	O
entrance	O
to	O
the	O
house	O
in	O
which	O
Mr	O
Verloc	O
carried	O
on	O
his	O
business	O
of	O
a	O
seller	O
of	O
shady	O
wares	O
,	O
exercised	O
his	O
vocation	O
of	O
a	O
protector	O
of	O
society	O
,	O
and	O
cultivated	O
his	O
domestic	O
virtues	O
.	O

These	O
last	O
were	O
pronounced	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
thoroughly	O

Neither	O
his	O
spiritual	O

nor	O
his	O

nor	O
his	O
physical	O
needs	O
were	O
of	O
the	O
kind	O
to	O
take	O
him	O
much	O
abroad	O

He	O
found	O
at	O

the	O
ease	O
of	O
his	O
body	O
and	O
the	O
peace	O
of	O
his	O

Winnie	O

Her	O

She	O
considered	O
herself	O
to	O
be	O
of	O

which	O
might	O

been	O
true	O
;	O
and	O
after	O
a	O

many	O

of	O

life	O
with	O
a	O

still	O
included	O
in	O
the	O

of	O

This	O
topographical	O
fact	O
was	O
of	O
some	O
advantage	O
in	O
advertising	O
her	O
rooms	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
patrons	O
of	O
the	O

not	O

Such	O
as	O
they	O
were	O

Traces	O
of	O
the	O

the	O

boasted	O
of	O

apparent	O
in	O

It	O
must	O
be	O
that	O
Mr	O

Mr	O

He	O

that	O

was	O
not	O

that	O

that	O

this	O
was	O

Under	O
