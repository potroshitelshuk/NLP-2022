,	O
the	O
watch	O
was	O
as	O
a	O
necessity	O
pulled	O
out	O

to	O
one	O

compressing	O
the	O

to	O
a	O

on	O

by	O
its	O
chain	O

But	O
some	O
thoughtfull	O
persons	O

who	O
had	O
seen	EVENT
him	O
walking	EVENT
across	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
fields	O
on	O
a	O
certain	O
December	O
morning	O
--	O
sunny	O
and	O
exceedingly	O
mild	O
--	O
might	O
have	O
regarded	O
Gabriel	O
Oak	O
in	O
other	O
aspects	O
than	O
these	O
.	O

In	O
his	O
face	O
one	O
might	O
notice	O
that	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
hues	O
and	O
curves	O
of	O
youth	O
had	O
tarried	O
on	O
to	O
manhood	O
:	O
there	O
even	O
remained	O
in	O
his	O
remoter	O
crannies	O
some	O
relics	O
of	O
the	O
boy	O
.	O

His	O
height	O
and	O
breadth	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
sufficient	O
to	O
make	O
his	O
presence	O
imposing	O
,	O
had	O
they	O
been	O
exhibited	O
with	O
due	O
consideration	O

But	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
way	O
some	O
men	O
have	O
,	O
rural	O
and	O
urban	O
alike	O
,	O
for	O
which	O
the	O
mind	O
is	O
more	O
responsible	O
than	O
flesh	O
and	O
sinew	O
:	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
way	O
of	O
curtail	O

ing	O
their	O
dimensions	O
by	O
their	O
manner	O
of	O
showing	O
them	O

And	O
from	O
a	O
quiet	O
modesty	O
that	O
would	O
have	O
become	O
a	O
vestal	O
which	O
seemed	O
continually	O
to	O
impress	O
upon	O
him	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
no	O
great	O
claim	O
on	O
the	O
world	O

Oak	O
walked	O
unassumingly	O

with	O
a	O
faintly	O

distinct	O
from	O
a	O

This	O
may	O
be	O

to	O
be	O
a	O
defect	O
