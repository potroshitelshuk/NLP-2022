lost	EVENT

for	O
the	O
summer	O
out	O
of	O
town	O
,	O
and	O
found	EVENT
herself	O
involved	O
in	O
one	O

crimes	O
that	O

our	O
newspapers	O
and	O

happy	O
and	O
prosperous	O
.	O

For	O
twenty	O
years	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
perfectly	O
comfortable	O
;	O
for	O
twenty	O
years	O
I	O
had	O
had	O
the	O
window-boxes	O
filled	O
in	O
the	O
spring	O
,	O
the	O
carpets	O
lifted	O

the	O

covered	O
with	O

;	O
for	O
as	O
many	O
summers	O
I	O
had	O
said	O
good-by	O
to	O
my	O
friends	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
after	O
watching	O
their	O
perspiring	O
hegira	O
,	O
had	O
settled	O
down	O
to	O
a	O
delicious	O
quiet	O
in	O
town	O

where	O
the	O
mail	O
comes	O
three	O
times	O
a	O
day	O

and	O
the	O
water	O
supply	O
does	O
not	O
depend	O
on	O
a	O
tank	O
on	O
the	O
roof	O
.	O

And	O
then	O
--	O
the	O
madness	EVENT
seized	O
me	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
look	EVENT
back	O
over	O
the	O
months	O
I	O
spent	O
at	O
Sunnyside	O
,	O
I	O
wonder	EVENT
that	O
I	O
survived	O
at	O
all	O

As	O
it	O
is	O
,	O
I	O
show	O
the	O
wear	O
and	O
tear	O
of	O
my	O
harrowing	O
experiences	O

I	O
have	O
turned	O
very	O
gray	O
--	O
Liddy	O
reminded	EVENT
me	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
only	O
yesterday	O
,	O
by	O
saying	EVENT
that	O
a	O
little	O
bluing	O
in	O
the	O
rinse-water	O
would	O
make	O
my	O
hair	O
silvery	O
,	O
instead	O
of	O
a	O
yellowish	O
white	O

I	O
hate	O
to	O
be	O
reminded	O
of	O
unpleasant	O
things	O
and	O
I	O
snapped	EVENT
her	O
off	O

"	O
No	O

when	O

around	O
with	O
a	O
lump	O
in	O
her	O

all	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
do	O
is	O
to	O
threaten	O

Sunnyside	O

and	O
she	O
is	O
frightened	O
into	O
a	O
semblance	O
of	O
cheerfulness	O
,	O
--	O
from	O
which	O
you	O
may	O
judge	O
that	O
the	O
summer	O
there	O
was	O
anything	O
but	O
a	O
success	O

The	O
newspaper	O
accounts	O
have	O
been	O
so	O
garbled	O
and	O
incomplete	O
--	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
mentioned	O
me	O

once	O

and	O
then	O
only	O
as	O
the	O
tenant	O
at	O
the	O
time	O

that	O
I	O

Mr.	O
Jamieson	O
,	O
the	O
detective	O

said	EVENT
himself	O
he	O
could	O
never	O

me	O

although	O
he	O
gave	O
me	O

I	O
shall	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
several	O
years	O
--	O
thirteen	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
exact	O
--	O
to	O
start	O
my	O
story	O

At	O
that	O
time	O
my	O
brother	O
died	EVENT
,	O
leaving	EVENT
me	O
his	O
two	O
children	O

Halsey	O
was	O
eleven	O
then	O

and	O
Gertrude	O
was	O
seven	O

All	O
the	O
responsibilities	O
of	O
maternity	O
were	O
thrust	EVENT
upon	O
me	O
suddenly	O
;	O
to	O
perfect	O
the	O
profession	O
of	O
motherhood	O
requires	O
precisely	O
as	O
many	O
years	O
as	O
the	O
child	O
has	O
lived	O
,	O
like	O
the	O
man	O
who	O
started	O
to	O
carry	O
the	O
calf	O
and	O
ended	O
by	O
walking	O
along	O
with	O
the	O
bull	O
on	O
his	O
shoulders	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
did	O
the	O
best	O
I	O
could	O
.	O

When	O
Gertrude	O
got	O
past	O
the	O
hair-ribbon	O
age	O
,	O
and	O
Halsey	O
asked	EVENT
for	O
a	O
scarf-pin	O
and	O
put	EVENT
on	O
long	O
trousers	O
--	O
and	O
a	O
wonderful	O
help	O
that	O
was	O
to	O
the	O
darning	O
.	O

--	O
I	O
sent	EVENT
them	O
away	O
to	O
good	O
schools	O
.	O

After	O
that	O
,	O
my	O
responsibility	O
was	O
chiefly	O
postal	O
,	O
with	O
three	O
months	O
every	O
summer	O
in	O
which	O
to	O
replenish	O
their	O
wardrobes	O
,	O
look	O
over	O
their	O
lists	O
of	O
acquaintances	O
,	O
and	O
generally	O
to	O
take	O
my	O
foster-motherhood	O
out	O
of	O
its	O
nine	O
months	O
'	O
retirement	O
in	O
camphor	O
.	O

I	O
missed	O
the	O
summers	O
with	O
them	O
when	O
,	O
somewhat	O
later	O
,	O
at	O
boarding-school	O
and	O
college	O
,	O
the	O
children	O
spent	O
much	O
of	O
their	O
vacations	O
with	O
friends	O
.	O

Gradually	O
I	O
found	O
that	O
my	O
name	O
signed	O
to	O
a	O
check	O
was	O
even	O
more	O
welcome	O
than	O
when	O
signed	O
to	O
a	O
letter	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
wrote	O
them	O
at	O
stated	O
intervals	O

But	O
when	O
Halsey	O
had	O
finished	EVENT
his	O
electrical	O
course	O
and	O
Gertrude	O
her	O
boarding-school	O
,	O
and	O
both	O
came	EVENT
home	O
to	O
stay	O
,	O
things	O
were	O
suddenly	O
changed	EVENT
.	O

The	O
winter	O
Gertrude	O
came	EVENT
out	O
was	O
nothing	O
but	O
a	O
succession	O
of	O
sitting	O
up	O
late	O
at	O
night	O
to	O
bring	O
her	O
home	O
from	O
things	O
,	O
taking	O
her	O
to	O
the	O
dressmakers	O
between	O
naps	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
discouraging	O

with	O
either	O

money	O
than	O
brains	O
,	O
or	O
more	O
brains	O
than	O
money	O
.	O

Also	O
,	O
I	O
acquired	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
things	O
:	O
to	O
say	O
lingerie	O
for	O
under-garments	O
,	O
"	O
frocks	O
"	O
and	O
"	O
gowns	O
"	O
instead	O
of	O
dresses	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
beardless	O
sophomores	O
are	O
not	O
college	O
boys	O
,	O
but	O
college	O
men	O
.	O

Halsey	O
required	O
less	O
personal	O
supervision	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
they	O
both	O
got	O
their	O
mother	O
's	O
fortune	O
that	O
winter	O
,	O
my	O
responsibility	O
became	O
purely	O
moral	O
.	O

Halsey	O
bought	EVENT
a	O
car	O
,	O
of	O
course	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
learned	EVENT
how	O
to	O
tie	O
over	O
my	O
bonnet	O
a	O
gray	O
baize	O
veil	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
after	O
a	O
time	O
,	O
never	O
to	O
stop	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
the	O
dogs	O
one	O
has	O
run	O
down	O
.	O

People	O
are	O
apt	O
to	O
be	O
so	O
unpleasant	O
about	O
their	O
dogs	O

The	O
additions	O
to	O
my	O
education	O
made	O
me	O
a	O
properly	O
equipped	O
maiden	O
aunt	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
spring	O
I	O
was	O
quite	O
tractable	O
.	O

So	O
when	O
Halsey	O
suggested	EVENT
camping	O
in	O
the	O
Adirondacks	O
and	O
Gertrude	O
wanted	O
Bar	O
Harbor	O
,	O
we	O
compromised	EVENT
on	O
a	O
good	O
country	O
house	O
with	O
links	O
near	O
,	O
within	O
motor	O
distance	O
of	O

of	O
the	O
doctor	O

That	O
was	O
how	O
we	O
went	EVENT
to	O
Sunnyside	O
.	O

We	O
went	EVENT
out	O
to	O
inspect	O
the	O
property	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
seemed	O
to	O
deserve	O
its	O
name	O
.	O

Its	O
cheerful	O
appearance	O
gave	O
no	O
indication	O
whatever	O
of	O
anything	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
ordinary	O
.	O

Only	O
one	O
thing	O
seemed	O
unusual	O
to	O
me	O
:	O
the	O
housekeeper	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
left	O
in	O
charge	O
,	O
had	O
moved	EVENT
from	O
the	O
house	O
to	O
the	O
gardener	O
's	O
lodge	O
,	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
before	O
.	O

As	O
the	O
lodge	O
was	O
far	O
enough	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
house	O
,	O
it	O
seemed	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
either	O
fire	O
or	O
thieves	O
could	O
complete	O
their	O
work	O
of	O
destruction	O
undisturbed	O
.	O

The	O
property	O
was	O
an	O
extensive	O
one	O
:	O
the	O
house	O
on	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
a	O
hill	O

sloped	O

to	O
the	O
road	O

and	O
across	O
the	O
valley	O

perhaps	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
miles	O
away	O
,	O
was	O
the	O
Greenwood	O
Club	O
House	O

Gertrude	O
and	O
Halsey	O
were	O
infatuated	O

"	O
Why	O
,	O
it	O
's	O
everything	O
you	O
want	O

"	O
Halsey	O
said	EVENT
"	O

As	O
for	O

it	O

"	O
which	O
was	O
ridiculous	O

it	O

pure	O
Elizabethan	O

Of	O
course	O
we	O
took	EVENT
the	O
place	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
my	O
idea	O
of	O
comfort	O

being	O
much	O
too	O
large	O
and	O
sufficiently	O
isolated	O
to	O

serious	O

I	O
give	O
myself	O
credit	O
for	O
this	O

whatever	O

I	O
never	O

:	O
if	O
the	O

of	O

there	O
did	O
nothing	O

it	O
taught	O

one	O
thing	O

that	O
somehow	O

somewhere	O

from	O

a	O
half-civilized	O
