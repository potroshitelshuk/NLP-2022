An	O
objection	O

be	O
apprehended	O
from	O
the	O
more	O
delicate	O
,	O
that	O
this	O

is	O
too	O
common	O

vulgar	O
;	O
for	O

with	O

Many	O
exquisite	O
viands	O
might	O
be	O
rejected	O
by	O
the	O
epicure	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
sufficient	O
cause	O
for	O
his	O
contemning	O
of	O
them	O
as	O
common	O
and	O
vulgar	O
,	O
that	O
something	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
found	O
in	O
the	O
most	O
paltry	O

under	O
the	O

In	O
reality	O

true	O

is	O
as	O
difficult	O

the	O
whole	O

to	O
continue	O
the	O

metaphor	O

consists	O
in	O
the	O
cookery	O
of	O
the	O
author	O
;	O
for	O

as	O
Mr	O
Pope	O

“	O

The	O

animal	O
which	O
hath	O
the	O
honour	O
to	O
have	O
some	O
part	O
of	O
his	O
flesh	O
eaten	O
at	O
the	O

of	O
a	O

may	O
perhaps	O
be	O
degraded	O
in	O
another	O
part	O

and	O
some	O
of	O
his	O
limbs	O
gibbeted	O

as	O
it	O
were	O

in	O
the	O
vilest	O

Where	O

then	O

lies	O
the	O
difference	O
between	O
the	O
food	O
of	O
the	O
nobleman	O

the	O
porter	O

if	O
both	O
are	O

the	O

garnishing	O

the	O

Hence	O
the	O
one	O
provokes	O
and	O
incites	O
the	O
most	O
languid	O
appetite	O

and	O
the	O
other	O
turns	O
and	O
palls	O
that	O
which	O
is	O
the	O
sharpest	O

In	O
like	O
manner	O
,	O
the	O
excellence	O
of	O
the	O
mental	O
entertainment	O
consists	O
less	O
in	O
