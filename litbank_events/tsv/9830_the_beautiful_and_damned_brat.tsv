So	O
to	O

life	O
was	O
a	O
struggle	O
against	O
death	O
,	O
that	O
waited	O
at	O
every	O
corner	O

It	O
was	O
as	O
a	O
concession	O
to	O
his	O
hypochondriacal	O
imagination	O
that	O
he	O
formed	O
the	O

there	O
was	O
a	O

fascination	O
in	O
transferring	O
his	O

interminably	O
from	O
one	O

to	O
another	O

His	O
stamps	O
were	O
his	O
greatest	O
happiness	O
and	O
he	O
bestowed	O
impatient	O

on	O
any	O
one	O
who	O
interrupted	O
him	O
at	O

them	O

they	O
devoured	O
his	O

and	O
he	O
lay	O
awake	O
at	O

musing	O
untiringly	O
on	O
their	O

At	O
sixteen	O
he	O
had	O
lived	O
almost	O
entirely	O
within	O
himself	O

an	O
inarticulate	O
boy	O

thoroughly	O
un-American	O

and	O
politely	O
bewildered	O
by	O
his	O
contemporaries	O

The	O
two	O
preceding	O

had	O
been	O
spent	O
in	O
Europe	O
with	O
a	O
private	O

who	O
persuaded	O
him	O
that	O
