THE	O
TWO	O
POETS	O
OF	O
SAFFRON	O
PARK	O
THE	O
suburb	O
of	O
Saffron	O
Park	O
lay	O
on	O
the	O
sunset	O
side	O
of	O
London	O
,	O
as	O
red	O
and	O
ragged	O
as	O
a	O
cloud	O
of	O
sunset	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
built	EVENT
of	O
a	O
bright	O
brick	O
throughout	O
;	O
its	O
sky-line	O
was	O
fantastic	O
,	O
and	O
even	O
its	O
ground	O
plan	O
was	O
wild	O
.	O

It	O
had	O
been	O
the	O
outburst	EVENT
of	O
a	O
speculative	O
builder	O
,	O
faintly	O
tinged	O
with	O
art	O
,	O
who	O
called	O
its	O
architecture	O
sometimes	O
Elizabethan	O
and	O
sometimes	O
Queen	O
Anne	O
,	O
apparently	O
under	O
the	O
impression	O
that	O
the	O
two	O
sovereigns	O
were	O
identical	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
described	O
with	O
some	O
justice	O
as	O
an	O
artistic	O
colony	O
,	O
though	O
it	O
never	O
in	O
any	O
definable	O
way	O
produced	O
any	O
art	O
.	O

But	O
although	O
its	O
pretensions	O
to	O
be	O
an	O
intellectual	O
centre	O
were	O
a	O
little	O
vague	O
,	O
its	O
pretensions	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
pleasant	O
place	O
were	O
quite	O
indisputable	O
.	O

The	O
stranger	O
who	O
looked	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
at	O
the	O
quaint	O
red	O
houses	O
could	O
only	O
think	O
how	O
very	O
oddly	O
shaped	O
the	O
people	O
must	O
be	O
who	O
could	O
fit	O
in	O
to	O
them	O
.	O

Nor	O
when	O
he	O
met	O
the	O
people	O
was	O
he	O
disappointed	O
in	O
this	O
respect	O
.	O

The	O
place	O
was	O
not	O
only	O
pleasant	O
,	O
but	O
perfect	O
,	O
if	O
once	O
he	O
could	O
regard	O
it	O
not	O
as	O
a	O
deception	O
but	O
rather	O
as	O
a	O
dream	O
.	O

Even	O
if	O
the	O
people	O
were	O
not	O
“	O
artists	O
,	O
”	O
the	O
whole	O
was	O
nevertheless	O
artistic	O
.	O

That	O
young	O
man	O
with	O
the	O
long	O
,	O
auburn	O
hair	O
and	O
the	O
impudent	O
face	O
--	O
that	O
young	O
man	O
was	O
not	O
really	O
a	O
poet	O
;	O
but	O
surely	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
poem	O
.	O

That	O
old	O
gentleman	O
with	O
the	O
wild	O
,	O
white	O
beard	O
and	O
the	O
wild	O
,	O
white	O
hat	O
--	O
that	O
venerable	O
humbug	O
was	O
not	O
really	O
a	O
philosopher	O
;	O
but	O
at	O
least	O
he	O
was	O
the	O
cause	O
of	O
philosophy	O
in	O
others	O
.	O

That	O
scientific	O
gentleman	O
with	O
the	O
bald	O
,	O
egg-like	O
head	O
and	O
the	O
bare	O
,	O
bird-like	O
neck	O
had	O
no	O
real	O
right	O
to	O
the	O
airs	O
of	O
science	O
that	O
he	O
assumed	O
.	O

He	O
had	O
not	O
discovered	O
anything	O
new	O
in	O
biology	O
;	O
but	O
what	O
biological	O
creature	O
could	O
he	O
have	O
discovered	O
more	O
singular	O
than	O
himself	O
?	O

Thus	O
,	O
and	O
thus	O
only	O
,	O
the	O
whole	O
place	O
had	O
properly	O
to	O
be	O
regarded	O
;	O
it	O
had	O
to	O
be	O
considered	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
a	O
workshop	O
for	O
artists	O
,	O
but	O
as	O
a	O
frail	O
but	O
finished	O
work	O
of	O
art	O
.	O

A	O
man	O
who	O
stepped	O
into	O
its	O
social	O
atmosphere	O
felt	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
stepped	O
into	O
a	O
written	O
comedy	O
.	O

More	O
especially	O
this	O
attractive	O
unreality	O
fell	O
upon	O
it	O
about	O
nightfall	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
extravagant	O
roofs	O
were	O
dark	O
against	O
the	O
afterglow	O
and	O
the	O
whole	O
insane	O
village	O
seemed	O
as	O
separate	O
as	O
a	O
drifting	O
cloud	O
.	O

This	O
again	O
was	O
more	O
strongly	O
true	O
of	O
the	O
many	O
nights	O
of	O
local	O
festivity	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
little	O
gardens	O
were	O
often	O
illuminated	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
big	O
Chinese	O
lanterns	O
glowed	O
in	O
the	O
dwarfish	O
trees	O
like	O
some	O
fierce	O
and	O
monstrous	O
fruit	O
.	O

And	O
this	O
was	O
strongest	O
of	O
all	O
on	O
one	O
particular	O
evening	O
,	O
still	O
vaguely	O
remembered	O
in	O
the	O
locality	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
the	O
auburn-haired	O
poet	O
was	O
the	O
hero	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
not	O
by	O
any	O
means	O
the	O
only	O
evening	O
of	O
which	O
he	O
was	O
the	O
hero	O
.	O

On	O
many	O
nights	O
those	O
passing	O
by	O
his	O
little	O
back	O
garden	O
might	O
hear	O
his	O
high	O
,	O
didactic	O
voice	O
laying	O
down	O
the	O
law	O
to	O
men	O
and	O
particularly	O
to	O
women	O
.	O

The	O
attitude	O
of	O
women	O
in	O
such	O
cases	O
was	O
indeed	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
paradoxes	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
.	O

Most	O
of	O
the	O
women	O
were	O
of	O
the	O
kind	O
vaguely	O
called	O
emancipated	O
,	O
and	O
professed	O
some	O
protest	O
against	O
male	O
supremacy	O
.	O

Yet	O
these	O
new	O
women	O
would	O
always	O
pay	O
to	O
a	O
man	O
the	O
extravagant	O
compliment	O
which	O
no	O
ordinary	O
woman	O
ever	O
pays	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
of	O
listening	O
while	O
he	O
is	O
talking	O
.	O

And	O
Mr.	O
Lucian	O
Gregory	O
,	O
the	O
red-haired	O
poet	O
,	O
was	O
really	O
(	O
in	O
some	O
sense	O
)	O
a	O
man	O
worth	O
listening	O
to	O
,	O
even	O
if	O
one	O
only	O
laughed	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

He	O
put	O
the	O
old	O
cant	O
of	O
the	O
lawlessness	O
of	O
art	O
and	O
the	O
art	O
of	O
lawlessness	O
with	O
a	O
certain	O
impudent	O
freshness	O
which	O
gave	O
at	O
least	O
a	O
momentary	O
pleasure	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
helped	O
in	O
some	O
degree	O
by	O
the	O
arresting	O
oddity	O
of	O
his	O
appearance	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
worked	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
phrase	O
goes	O
,	O
for	O
all	O
it	O
was	O
worth	O
.	O

His	O
dark	O
red	O
hair	O
parted	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
was	O
literally	O
like	O
a	O
woman	O
’s	O
,	O
and	O
curved	O
into	O
the	O
slow	O
curls	O
of	O
a	O
virgin	O
in	O
a	O
pre-Raphaelite	O
picture	O
.	O

From	O
within	O
this	O
almost	O
saintly	O
oval	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
his	O
face	O
projected	O
suddenly	O
broad	O
and	O
brutal	O
,	O
the	O
chin	O
carried	O
forward	O
with	O
a	O
look	O
of	O
cockney	O
contempt	O
.	O

This	O
combination	O
at	O
once	O
tickled	O
and	O
terrified	O
the	O
nerves	O
of	O
a	O
neurotic	O
population	O
.	O

He	O
seemed	O
like	O
a	O
walking	O
blasphemy	O
,	O
a	O
blend	O
of	O
the	O
angel	O
and	O
the	O
ape	O
.	O

This	O
particular	O
evening	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
is	O
remembered	O
for	O
nothing	O
else	O
,	O
will	O
be	O

strange	O
sunset	EVENT

It	O
looked	O

All	O
the	O

seemed	O
covered	O
with	O
a	O
quite	O
vivid	O
and	O
palpable	O
plumage	O

you	O
could	O
only	O
say	O
that	O
the	O
sky	O
was	O
full	O
of	O
feathers	O

and	O
of	O
feathers	O
that	O
almost	O
brushed	O
the	O
face	O

Across	O
the	O
