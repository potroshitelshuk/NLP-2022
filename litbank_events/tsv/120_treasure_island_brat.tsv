we	O

Every	O

At	O
first	O
we	O
thought	EVENT
it	O
was	O
the	O
want	O

that	O
made	O
him	O
ask	O
this	O

at	O

we	O

through	O

and	O
he	O
was	O

down	O

before	O

How	O
that	O
personage	O
haunted	O
my	O
dreams	O
,	O
I	O
need	O
scarcely	O
tell	O
you	O

On	O
stormy	O
nights	O

when	O
the	O

shook	O

four	O
corners	O
of	O
the	O

the	O
surf	O
roared	O
along	O
the	O
cove	O
and	O
up	O
the	O

I	O
would	O
see	O
him	O
in	O
a	O
thousand	O
forms	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
a	O
thousand	O
diabolical	O
expressions	O

Now	O
the	O

would	O
be	O
cut	O
off	O

now	O
at	O

now	O

never	O

the	O
one	O

that	O
in	O
the	O

see	O
him	O
leap	O
and	O
run	O
and	O
pursue	O
me	O
over	O
hedge	O
and	O
ditch	O
was	O
the	O
worst	O
of	O
nightmares	O

And	O
altogether	O
I	O
paid	O
pretty	O
dear	O
for	O
my	O
monthly	O
fourpenny	O
piece	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
shape	O
of	O
these	O

But	O
though	O
I	O
was	O
so	O
terrified	O
by	O
the	O
idea	O
of	O
the	O
seafaring	O
man	O
with	O
one	O

,	O
I	O
was	O
far	O
less	O
afraid	O
of	O
the	O
captain	O
himself	O
than	O
anybody	O
else	O
who	O
knew	O
him	O

There	O
were	O
nights	O
when	O
he	O
took	O
a	O
deal	O
more	O
rum	O
and	O
water	O
than	O
his	O
head	O
would	O
carry	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
he	O
would	O
sometimes	O
sit	O

sing	O
his	O
wicked	O
,	O
old	O
,	O
wild	O
sea-songs	O

to	O
listen	O
to	O

bear	O
a	O

Often	O
I	O
have	O
heard	O
the	O

a	O

in	O
these	O
fits	O
he	O
was	O
the	O
most	O
overriding	O
companion	O
ever	O
known	O

he	O
would	O
slap	O
his	O
hand	O
on	O
the	O
table	O
for	O
silence	O
all	O
round	O

would	O
fly	O
up	O

a	O
passion	O

anger	O
at	O
a	O
question	O

or	O
sometimes	O
because	O
none	O

so	O
he	O
judged	O
the	O
company	O

I	O

him	O

I	O
am	O
sure	O
the	O
annoyance	O

the	O

he	O

death	EVENT

All	O

it	O

I	O
remember	EVENT
the	O
appearance	O

He	O
