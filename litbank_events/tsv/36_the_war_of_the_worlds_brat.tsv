No	O

have	O
believed	O
in	O
the	O
last	O
years	O
of	O
the	O
nineteenth	O
century	O
that	O
this	O

was	O
being	O
watched	O
keenly	O

closely	O
by	O
intelligences	O
greater	O
than	O
man	O

and	O
yet	O
as	O
mortal	O
as	O
his	O

;	O
that	O
as	O
men	O
busied	O
themselves	O
about	O
their	O
various	O
concerns	O
they	O
were	O
scrutinised	O
and	O
studied	O
,	O
perhaps	O
almost	O
as	O
narrowly	O
as	O
a	O
man	O
with	O
a	O
microscope	O
might	O
scrutinise	O
the	O
transient	O
creatures	O
that	O
swarm	O
and	O
multiply	O
in	O
a	O
drop	O
of	O

With	O
infinite	O
complacency	O
men	O
went	O
to	O
and	O
fro	O
over	O
this	O

about	O
their	O

serene	O
in	O

It	O
is	O
possible	O
that	O
the	O
infusoria	O
under	O
the	O
microscope	O
do	O
the	O

No	O
one	O
gave	O
a	O

as	O
sources	O
of	O
human	O
danger	O

or	O
thought	O

to	O
dismiss	O
the	O
idea	O
of	O

them	O
as	O
impossible	O
or	O

It	O
is	O
curious	O
to	O
recall	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
mental	O
habits	O
of	O
those	O
departed	O
days	O

At	O

terrestrial	O

The	O

140,000,000	O

and	O
the	O
light	O

heat	O
it	O

from	O
the	O

barely	O
half	O

It	O
must	O

older	O

before	O
this	O

life	O
upon	O

The	O

that	O
it	O
is	O
scarcely	O
one	O

of	O
the	O

the	O

so	O

so	O

The	O
secular	O

that	O

already	O
gone	O

Its	O
physical	O
condition	O
is	O
still	O
largely	O
a	O
mystery	O

we	O
know	O
now	O
that	O
even	O
in	O

equatorial	O
region	O
the	O
midday	O
temperature	O
barely	O
approaches	O
that	O

Its	O
air	O
is	O
much	O
more	O
attenuated	O
than	O
ours	O

its	O

have	O
shrunk	O
until	O
they	O
cover	O

a	O

about	O

That	O

of	O
exhaustion	O

which	O
to	O
us	O
is	O
still	O
incredibly	O
remote	O

has	O
become	O
a	O
present-day	O
problem	O
for	O
the	O

The	O

pressure	O

And	O
we	O

the	O

The	O
intellectual	O
side	O
of	O
man	O
already	O
admits	O
that	O
life	O
is	O
an	O
incessant	O
struggle	O
for	O
existence	O

and	O
it	O
would	O
seem	O
that	O
this	O

is	O
the	O
belief	O
of	O

Mars	O

Their	O

this	O

crowded	O
only	O
with	O
what	O
they	O

To	O

And	O
before	O
we	O

we	O
must	O
remember	O
what	O
ruthless	O
