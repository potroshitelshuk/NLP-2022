the	O

they	O
curried	O

For	O
all	O
their	O
seeming	O

they	O
might	O

buffaloes	O

or	O
the	O
buffalo	O

that	O
grew	O

The	O

have	O
been	O
transformed	O
into	O
other	O
likenesses	O

or	O
swept	O
away	O

like	O

that	O
the	O
“	O

the	O
“	O

and	O
the	O
whole	O
tribe	O
of	O
the	O
“	O

”	O
all	O
are	O
gone	O

They	O
went	O
quickly	O
,	O
yet	O
so	O
silently	O
that	O
we	O
whom	O
they	O
served	O
have	O
not	O
yet	O
really	O
noticed	O
that	O
they	O
are	O

So	O
with	O
other	O
vanishings	O

There	O
were	O
the	O
little	O
bunty	O
street-cars	O
on	O
the	O
long	O
,	O
single	O
track	O
that	O
went	O
its	O
troubled	O
way	O
among	O
the	O
cobblestones	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
rear	O
door	O
of	O
the	O
car	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
platform	O
,	O
but	O
a	O
step	O
where	O
passengers	O
clung	O
in	O
wet	O
clumps	O
when	O
the	O
weather	O
was	O
bad	O
and	O
the	O
car	O
crowded	O
.	O

The	O
patrons	O
--	O
if	O
not	O
too	O
absent-minded	O
--	O
put	O
their	O
fares	O
into	O
a	O
slot	O
;	O
and	O
no	O
conductor	O
paced	O
the	O
heaving	O
floor	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
driver	O
would	O
rap	O
remindingly	O
with	O
his	O
elbow	O
upon	O
the	O
glass	O
of	O
the	O
door	O
to	O
his	O
little	O
open	O
platform	O
if	O
the	O
nickels	O
and	O
the	O
passengers	O
did	O
not	O
appear	O
to	O
coincide	O
in	O
number	O
.	O

A	O
lone	O
mule	O
drew	O
the	O
car	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
drew	O
it	O
off	O
the	O
track	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
passengers	O
would	O
get	O
out	O
and	O
push	O
it	O
on	O
again	O
.	O

They	O
really	O
owed	O
it	O
courtesies	O
like	O
this	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
car	O
was	O
genially	O
accommodating	O
:	O
a	O
lady	O
could	O
whistle	O
to	O
it	O
from	O
an	O
upstairs	O
window	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
car	O
would	O
halt	O
at	O
once	O
and	O
wait	O
for	O
her	O
while	O
she	O
shut	O
the	O
window	O
,	O
put	O
on	O
her	O
hat	O
and	O
cloak	O
,	O
went	O
downstairs	O
,	O
found	O
an	O
umbrella	O
,	O
told	O
the	O
“	O
girl	O
”	O
what	O
to	O
have	O
for	O
dinner	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
forth	O
from	O
the	O
house	O
.	O

The	O
previous	O
passengers	O
made	O
little	O
objection	O
to	O
such	O
gallantry	O
on	O
the	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
car	O
:	O
they	O
were	O
wont	O
to	O
expect	O
as	O
much	O
for	O
themselves	O
on	O
like	O
occasion	O
.	O

In	O
good	O
weather	O
the	O
mule	O
pulled	O
the	O
car	O
a	O
mile	O
in	O
a	O
little	O
less	O
than	O
twenty	O
minutes	O
,	O
unless	O
the	O
stops	O
were	O
too	O
long	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
the	O
trolley-car	O
came	O
,	O
doing	O
its	O
mile	O
in	O
five	O
minutes	O
and	O
better	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
wait	O
for	O
nobody	O
.	O

Nor	O
could	O
its	O
passengers	O
have	O
endured	O
such	O
a	O
thing	O
,	O
because	O
the	O
faster	O
they	O
were	O
carried	O
the	O
less	O
time	O
they	O
had	O
to	O
spare	O
!	O
