but	O
Miss	O
Jemima	O
had	O
already	O
whimpered	O
several	O
times	O
at	O
the	O
idea	O
of	O
Amelia	O
's	O
departure	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
but	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
her	O
sister	O
,	O
would	O
have	O
gone	O
off	O
in	O
downright	O
hysterics	O
,	O
like	O
the	O
heiress	O
(	O
who	O
paid	O
double	O
)	O
of	O
St.	O
Kitt	O
's	O

Such	O
luxury	O
of	O
grief	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
is	O
only	O
allowed	O
to	O
parlour-boarders	O

Honest	O
Jemima	O
had	O
all	O
the	O
bills	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
washing	O

and	O
the	O

the	O

and	O
the	O
plate	O

crockery	O

and	O
the	O
servants	O
to	O
superintend	O

But	O
why	O
speak	O
about	O
her	O
?	O

It	O
is	O
probable	O
that	O
we	O
shall	O
not	O
hear	O
of	O
her	O
again	O
from	O
this	O
moment	O
to	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
when	O
the	O
great	O
filigree	O
iron	O
gates	O
are	O
once	O
closed	O
on	O
her	O

she	O
and	O
her	O
awful	O
sister	O
will	O
never	O
issue	O
therefrom	O
into	O
this	O
little	O
world	O
of	O
history	O

But	O
as	O
we	O
are	O
to	O
see	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
Amelia	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
harm	O
in	O
saying	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
outset	O
of	O
our	O
acquaintance	O
,	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
a	O
dear	O
little	O
creature	O
;	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
mercy	O
it	O
is	O
,	O
both	O
in	O
life	O
and	O
in	O
novels	O
,	O
which	O
(	O
and	O
the	O
latter	O
especially	O
)	O
abound	O
in	O
villains	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
sombre	O
sort	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
are	O
to	O
have	O
for	O
a	O
constant	O
companion	O
so	O
guileless	O
and	O
good-natured	O
a	O
person	O

As	O
she	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
heroine	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
need	O
to	O
describe	O
her	O
person	O
;	O
indeed	O
I	O
am	O
afraid	O
that	O
her	O
nose	O
was	O
rather	O
short	O
than	O
otherwise	O
,	O
and	O
her	O
cheeks	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
too	O
round	O
and	O
red	O
for	O
a	O
heroine	O
;	O
but	O
her	O
face	O
blushed	O
with	O
rosy	O
health	O
,	O
and	O
her	O
lips	O
with	O
the	O
freshest	O
of	O
smiles	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
had	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
eyes	O
which	O
sparkled	O
with	O
the	O
brightest	O
and	O
honestest	O
good-humour	O
,	O
except	O
indeed	O
when	O
they	O
filled	O
with	O
tears	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
too	O
often	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
silly	O
thing	O
would	O
cry	O
over	O
a	O
dead	O
canary-bird	O
;	O
or	O
over	O
a	O
mouse	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
cat	O
haply	O
had	O
seized	O
upon	O
;	O
or	O
over	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
a	O
novel	O

were	O
it	O
ever	O
so	O
stupid	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
for	O
saying	O
an	O
unkind	O
word	O
to	O
her	O
,	O
were	O
any	O
persons	O
hard-hearted	O

to	O

Even	O
Miss	O
