they	O

that	O
was	O
just	O
the	O

Every	O
afternoon	O
before	O
the	O
gates	O
closed	O
and	O
the	O
market	O

went	O
out	O
in	O

by	O
the	O
various	O
barricades	O
,	O
some	O
fool	O
of	O
an	O

endeavoured	O
to	O
evade	O
the	O
clutches	O
of	O
the	O
Committee	O
of	O
Public	O
Safety	O
.	O

In	O
various	O
disguises	O
,	O
under	O
various	O
pretexts	O
,	O
they	O
tried	O
to	O
slip	O
through	O
the	O
barriers	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
so	O
well	O
guarded	O
by	O
citizen	O

of	O

Men	O
in	O

there	O
were	O
some	O
of	O
all	O
sorts	O
:	O
CI-DEVANT	O
counts	O
,	O
marquises	O
,	O
even	O
dukes	O
,	O
who	O
wanted	O
to	O
fly	O
from	O
France	O
,	O
reach	O
England	O
or	O
some	O
other	O
equally	O
accursed	O
country	O

and	O
there	O
try	O
to	O
rouse	O
foreign	O
feelings	O
against	O
the	O
glorious	O
Revolution	O

or	O
to	O
raise	O
an	O
army	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
liberate	O
the	O
wretched	O
prisoners	O
in	O
the	O
Temple	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
once	O
called	O
themselves	O
sovereigns	O
of	O
France	O
.	O

But	O
they	O
were	O
nearly	O
always	O
caught	O
at	O
the	O
barricades	O
,	O
Sergeant	O
Bibot	O
especially	O
at	O
the	O
West	O
Gate	O
had	O
a	O
wonderful	O
nose	O
for	O
scenting	O
an	O
aristo	O
in	O
the	O
most	O
perfect	O
disguise	O
.	O

Then	O
,	O
of	O
course	O
,	O
the	O
fun	O
began	O
.	O

Bibot	O
would	O
look	O
at	O
his	O
prey	O
as	O
a	O
cat	O
looks	O
upon	O
the	O
mouse	O
,	O
play	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
sometimes	O
for	O
quite	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
an	O
hour	O
,	O
pretend	O
to	O
be	O
hoodwinked	O
by	O
the	O
disguise	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
wigs	O
and	O
other	O
bits	O
of	O
theatrical	O
make-up	O
which	O
hid	O
the	O
identity	O
of	O
a	O
CI-DEVANT	O
noble	O
marquise	O
or	O
count	O
.	O

Oh	O
!	O

Bibot	O
had	O
a	O
keen	O
sense	O
of	O
humour	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
well	O
worth	O
hanging	O
round	O
that	O
West	O
Barricade	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
see	O
him	O
catch	O
an	O
aristo	O
in	O
the	O
very	O
act	O
of	O
trying	O
to	O
flee	O
from	O
the	O
vengeance	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
.	O

Sometimes	O
Bibot	O
would	O
let	O
his	O
prey	O
actually	O
out	O
by	O
the	O
gates	O
,	O
allowing	O
him	O
to	O
think	O
for	O
the	O
space	O
of	O
two	O
minutes	O
at	O
least	O
that	O
he	O
really	O
had	O
escaped	O
out	O
of	O
Paris	O
,	O
and	O
might	O
even	O
manage	O
to	O
reach	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
England	O
in	O
safety	O
,	O
but	O
Bibot	O
would	O
let	O
the	O
unfortunate	O
wretch	O
walk	O
about	O
ten	O
metres	O
towards	O
the	O
open	O
country	O
,	O
then	O
he	O
would	O
send	O
two	O
men	O
after	O
him	O
and	O
bring	O
him	O
back	O
,	O
stripped	O
of	O
his	O
disguise	O
.	O

Oh	O
!	O

that	O
was	O
extremely	O
funny	O
,	O
for	O
as	O
often	O
as	O
not	O
the	O
fugitive	O
would	O
prove	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
woman	O
,	O
some	O
proud	O
marchioness	O
,	O
who	O
looked	O
terribly	O
comical	O
when	O
she	O
found	O
herself	O
in	O
Bibot	O
's	O
clutches	O
after	O
all	O
,	O
and	O
knew	O
that	O
a	O
summary	O
trial	O
would	O
await	O
her	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
and	O
after	O
that	O
,	O
the	O
fond	O
embrace	O
of	O
Madame	O
la	O
Guillotine	O
.	O

No	O
wonder	O
that	O
on	O
this	O
fine	O
afternoon	O
in	O
September	O
the	O
crowd	O
round	O
Bibot	O
's	O
gate	O
was	O
eager	O
and	O
excited	O
.	O

The	O
lust	O
of	O
blood	O
grows	O
with	O
its	O
satisfaction	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
satiety	O
:	O
the	O
crowd	O
had	O
seen	O
a	O
hundred	O
noble	O
heads	O
fall	O
beneath	O
the	O
guillotine	O
to-day	O
,	O
it	O
wanted	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
see	O
another	O
hundred	O
fall	O
on	O
the	O
morrow	O
.	O

Bibot	O
was	O
sitting	O
on	O
an	O
overturned	O
and	O
empty	O
cask	O
close	O
by	O
the	O
gate	O
of	O
the	O
barricade	O
;	O
a	O
small	O
detachment	O
of	O
citoyen	O
soldiers	O
was	O
under	O
his	O
command	O
.	O

The	O
work	O
had	O
been	O
very	O
hot	O
lately	O
.	O

Those	O
cursed	O
aristos	O
were	O
becoming	O
terrified	O
and	O
tried	O
their	O
hardest	O
to	O
slip	O
out	O
of	O
Paris	O
:	O
men	O
,	O
women	O
and	O
children	O
,	O
whose	O
ancestors	O
,	O
even	O
in	O
remote	O
ages	O
,	O
had	O
served	O
those	O
traitorous	O
Bourbons	O
,	O
were	O
all	O
traitors	O
themselves	O
and	O
right	O
food	O
for	O
the	O
guillotine	O

Every	O
day	O
Bibot	O
had	O
had	O
the	O
satisfaction	O
of	O
unmasking	O
some	O
fugitive	O
royalists	O
and	O
sending	O
them	O
back	O
to	O
be	O
tried	O
by	O
the	O
Committee	O
of	O
Public	O
Safety	O
,	O
presided	O
over	O
by	O
that	O
good	O
patriot	O
,	O
Citoyen	O
Foucquier-Tinville	O
.	O

Robespierre	O
and	O
Danton	O
both	O
had	O
commended	O
Bibot	O
for	O
his	O
zeal	O
and	O
Bibot	O
was	O
proud	O
of	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
he	O
on	O
his	O
own	O
initiative	O
had	O
sent	O
at	O
least	O
fifty	O
aristos	O
to	O
the	O
guillotine	O
.	O

But	O
to-day	O
all	O
the	O
sergeants	O
in	O
command	O
at	O
the	O
various	O
barricades	O
had	O
had	O
special	O
orders	EVENT
.	O

Recently	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
aristos	O
had	O
succeeded	O
in	O
escaping	O
out	O
of	O
France	O
and	O
in	O
reaching	O
England	O
safely	O
.	O

There	O
were	O
curious	O
rumours	O
about	O
these	O
escapes	O
;	O
they	O
had	O
become	O
very	O
frequent	O
and	O
singularly	O
daring	O
;	O
the	O
people	O
's	O
minds	O
were	O
becoming	O
strangely	O
excited	O
about	O
it	O
all	O
.	O

Sergeant	O
Grospierre	O
had	O
been	O
sent	EVENT
to	O
the	O
guillotine	O
for	O
allowing	EVENT
a	O
whole	O
family	O
of	O
aristos	O
to	O
slip	EVENT
out	O
of	O
the	O
North	O
Gate	O
under	O
his	O
very	O
nose	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
asserted	O
that	O
these	O
escapes	O
were	O
organised	O
by	O
a	O
band	O
of	O
Englishmen	O
,	O
whose	O
daring	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
unparalleled	O
,	O
and	O
who	O

from	O
sheer	O
desire	O
to	O
meddle	O
in	O
what	O
did	O
not	O
concern	O
them	O

spent	O
their	O

time	O
in	O
snatching	O
away	O
lawful	O
victims	O
destined	O
for	O
Madame	O
la	O

These	O
rumours	O
soon	O
grew	O
in	O
extravagance	O
;	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
doubt	O
that	O
this	O
band	O
of	O
meddlesome	O
Englishmen	O
did	O
exist	O
;	O
moreover	O
,	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
under	O
the	O
leadership	O
of	O
a	O
man	O
whose	O
pluck	O
and	O
audacity	O
were	O
almost	O
fabulous	O
.	O

Strange	O
stories	O
were	O
afloat	O
of	O
how	O
he	O
and	O
those	O
aristos	O
whom	O
he	O
rescued	O
became	O
suddenly	O
invisible	O
as	O
they	O
reached	O
the	O
barricades	O
and	O
escaped	O
out	O
of	O
the	O

by	O
sheer	O
supernatural	O
agency	O

No	O
one	O

these	O
mysterious	O
Englishmen	O

as	O
for	O
their	O

Citoyen	O
Foucquier-Tinville	O
would	O
in	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
receive	O
a	O
scrap	O
of	O
paper	O
from	O
some	O
mysterious	O
source	O

sometimes	O
he	O
would	O
find	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
pocket	O
of	O
his	O
coat	O

at	O
others	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
handed	O
to	O
him	O

The	O
paper	O

contained	O
a	O

notice	O
that	O

it	O

notice	O

the	O
citoyens	O
of	O

would	O
hear	O
that	O
