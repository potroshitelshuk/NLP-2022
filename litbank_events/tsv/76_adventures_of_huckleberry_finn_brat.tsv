The	O

but	O
it	O
was	O
rough	O
living	O
in	O
the	O
house	O
all	O
the	O
time	O

considering	O
how	O
dismal	O
regular	O

the	O
widow	O

in	O
all	O

I	O
would	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
widow	O
and	O
be	O
respectable	O

So	O
I	O
went	EVENT
back	O

The	O
widow	O
she	O
cried	EVENT
over	O
me	O

and	O
called	EVENT

and	O
she	O

but	O
she	O
never	O

She	O
put	EVENT
me	O

for	O
the	O
widow	O
to	O
tuck	O
down	O
her	O

and	O
grumble	O

After	O

that	O
Moses	O
had	O
been	O
dead	O
a	O

;	O
so	O
then	O
I	O
did	O
n't	O
care	O
no	O
more	O
about	O

because	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O

Pretty	O
soon	O
I	O

She	O

and	O
I	O
must	O
try	O
to	O
not	O

it	O
any	O
more	O

That	O
is	O
just	O
the	O
way	O
with	O
some	O

They	O
get	O

on	O
a	O

And	O
she	O
took	O
snuff	O

too	O
;	O
of	O
course	O
that	O
was	O
all	O
right	O

Her	O

She	O
worked	EVENT
me	O
middling	O

the	O

her	O
ease	EVENT
up	O

I	O
could	O
n't	O
stood	O
it	O

Then	O
for	O
an	O
hour	O
it	O
was	O
deadly	O
dull	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
fidgety	O

Miss	O
Watson	O
would	O
say	O

“	O
Do	O
n't	O
put	O
your	O
feet	O
up	O
there	O
,	O
Huckleberry	O
;	O
”	O
and	O
“	O
Do	O

Huckleberry	O

set	O
up	O

”	O
and	O
pretty	O
soon	O
she	O

“	O
Do	O

Huckleberry	O
--	O
why	O

”	O

Then	O
she	O
told	EVENT
me	O
all	O
about	O
the	O
bad	O
place	O

and	O
I	O
said	EVENT
I	O
wished	O
I	O
was	O
there	O

She	O
got	O
mad	EVENT
then	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
did	O

All	O
I	O

all	O
I	O
wanted	O
was	O
a	O
change	O

I	O
war	O
n't	O
particular	O

She	O
said	EVENT
it	O
was	O
wicked	O
to	O
say	O
what	O
I	O
said	EVENT
;	O
said	EVENT
she	O
would	O
n't	O
say	O
it	O
for	O
the	O
whole	O
world	O
;	O
she	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
live	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
go	O

Well	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
n't	O
see	O
no	O
advantage	O
in	O
going	O
where	O
she	O
was	O
going	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
made	EVENT
up	O
my	O
mind	O
I	O
would	O
n't	O
try	O
for	O
it	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
never	O
said	O
so	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
would	O
only	O
make	O
trouble	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
n't	O
do	O
no	O
good	O

Now	O
she	O
had	O
got	O
a	O
start	O

and	O
she	O
went	EVENT
on	O
and	O
told	EVENT
me	O

She	O

So	O
I	O
did	O

it	O

But	O
I	O
never	O
said	O

I	O
asked	EVENT

and	O
she	O
said	EVENT
