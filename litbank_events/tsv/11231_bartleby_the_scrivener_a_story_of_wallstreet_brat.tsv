young	O
man	O

I	O

deemed	O
him	O
the	O
victim	O
of	O
two	O
evil	O
powers	O
--	O
ambition	O
and	O
indigestion	O
.	O

The	O
ambition	O
was	O
evinced	O
by	O
a	O
certain	O
impatience	O
of	O
the	O
duties	O
of	O
a	O
mere	O
copyist	O

as	O

indigestion	O
seemed	O
betokened	O
in	O

occasional	O
nervous	O
testiness	O

especially	O
by	O
a	O
continual	O
discontent	O
with	O
the	O
height	O
of	O
the	O

of	O

Nippers	O
could	O
never	O

this	O

various	O

If	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
sake	O
of	O
easing	O
his	O
back	O

he	O
brought	O
the	O
table	O
lid	O
at	O
a	O
sharp	O
angle	O
well	O
up	O
towards	O
his	O
chin	O
,	O
and	O
wrote	O

man	O
using	O
the	O
steep	O
roof	O
of	O
a	O
Dutch	O
house	O

declared	O
that	O
it	O
stopped	O
the	O
circulation	O
in	O

If	O
now	O
he	O
lowered	O

stooped	O
over	O
it	O
in	O

the	O
truth	O
of	O

Among	O
the	O
manifestations	O
of	O
his	O
diseased	O
ambition	O
was	O
a	O
fondness	O
he	O
had	O
for	O
receiving	O
visits	O
from	O
certain	O
ambiguous-looking	O
fellows	O
in	O
seedy	O
coats	O
,	O
whom	O
he	O
called	O
his	O
clients	O

Indeed	O
I	O
was	O
aware	O
that	O
not	O
only	O
was	O
he	O
,	O
at	O
times	O
,	O
considerable	O
of	O
a	O
ward-politician	O

but	O
he	O
occasionally	O
did	O
a	O
little	O
business	O
at	O
the	O
Justices	O

courts	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
not	O
unknown	O
on	O
the	O
steps	O
of	O
the	O
Tombs	O

I	O
have	O
good	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
that	O
one	O
individual	O
who	O
called	O
upon	O
him	O
at	O
my	O
chambers	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
grand	O
air	O

he	O
insisted	O
was	O
his	O
client	O

was	O
no	O
other	O
than	O
a	O
dun	O

and	O
the	O
alleged	O
title-deed	O

a	O
bill	O

But	O
with	O
all	O
his	O
failings	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
annoyances	O
he	O
caused	O
me	O
,	O
Nippers	O
,	O
like	O
his	O
compatriot	O
Turkey	O
,	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
useful	O
man	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
wrote	O
a	O
neat	O
,	O
swift	O
hand	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
chose	O

was	O
not	O
deficient	O
in	O
a	O
gentlemanly	O
sort	O
of	O
deportment	O

Added	O
to	O
this	O
,	O
he	O
always	O
dressed	O
in	O
a	O
gentlemanly	O
sort	O
of	O
way	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
,	O
incidentally	O
,	O
reflected	O
credit	O
upon	O
my	O
chambers	O

Whereas	O
with	O
respect	O
to	O
Turkey	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
much	O
ado	O
to	O
keep	O
him	O
from	O
being	O
a	O
reproach	O
to	O
me	O
.	O

His	O
clothes	O
were	O
apt	O
to	O
look	O
oily	O
and	O
smell	O
of	O
eating-houses	O
.	O

He	O
wore	O
his	O
pantaloons	O
very	O
loose	O
and	O
baggy	O
in	O
summer	O
.	O

His	O
coats	O
were	O
execrable	O
;	O
his	O
hat	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
handled	O
.	O

But	O
while	O
the	O
hat	O
was	O
a	O
thing	O
of	O
indifference	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
inasmuch	O
as	O
his	O
natural	O
civility	O
and	O
deference	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
dependent	O
Englishman	O
,	O
always	O
led	O
him	O
to	O
doff	O
it	O
the	O
moment	O
he	O
entered	O
the	O
room	O
,	O
yet	O
his	O
coat	O
was	O
another	O
matter	O
.	O

Concerning	O
his	O
coats	O
,	O
I	O
reasoned	O
with	O
him	O
;	O
but	O
with	O
no	O
effect	O
.	O

The	O
truth	O
was	O
,	O
I	O
suppose	O
,	O
that	O
a	O
man	O
of	O
so	O
small	O
an	O
income	O
,	O
could	O
not	O
afford	O
to	O
sport	O
such	O
a	O
lustrous	O
face	O
and	O
a	O
lustrous	O
coat	O
at	O
one	O
and	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
.	O

As	O
Nippers	O
once	O
observed	O
,	O
Turkey	O
's	O
money	O
went	O
chiefly	O
for	O
red	O
ink	O
.	O

One	O
winter	O
day	O
I	O
presented	EVENT
Turkey	O
with	O
a	O
highly-respectable	O
looking	O
coat	O
of	O
my	O
own	O
,	O
a	O
padded	O
gray	O
coat	O
,	O
of	O
a	O
most	O
comfortable	O
warmth	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
buttoned	O
straight	O
up	O
from	O
the	O
knee	O
to	O
the	O
neck	O
.	O

I	O
thought	O
Turkey	O
would	O
appreciate	O
the	O
favor	EVENT
,	O
and	O
abate	O
his	O
rashness	O
and	O
obstreperousness	O
of	O
afternoons	O
.	O

But	O
no	O
.	O

I	O
verily	O
believe	O
that	O
buttoning	O
himself	O
up	O
in	O
so	O
downy	O
and	O
blanket-like	O
a	O
coat	O
had	O
a	O
pernicious	O
effect	O
upon	O
him	O
;	O
upon	O
the	O
same	O
principle	O
that	O
too	O
much	O
oats	O
are	O
bad	O
for	O
horses	O

In	O
fact	O

precisely	O
as	O
a	O
rash	O

restive	O
horse	O
is	O
said	O
to	O
feel	O
his	O
oats	O

so	O
Turkey	O
felt	O
his	O
coat	O

It	O
made	O

insolent	O
