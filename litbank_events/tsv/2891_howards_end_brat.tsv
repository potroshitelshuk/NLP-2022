Dearest	O
Meg	O

It	O
is	O

going	O

It	O

and	O
altogether	O
delightful	O

red	O

We	O

knows	O
what	O
will	O
happen	O
when	O
Paul	O
(	O
younger	O

)	O
arrives	O
tomorrow	O

From	O
hall	O
you	O
go	O
right	O
or	O

into	O
dining-room	O
or	O
drawing-room	O

Hall	O
itself	O
is	O
practically	O
a	O
room	O

You	O
open	O
another	O
door	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
are	O
the	O
stairs	O
going	O
up	O
in	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
tunnel	O
to	O
the	O
first-floor	O

Three	O
bedrooms	O
in	O
a	O
row	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
three	O
attics	O
in	O
a	O
row	O

That	O
is	O
n't	O
all	O
the	O
house	O
really	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
all	O
that	O
one	O
notices	O
--	O
nine	O
windows	O
as	O
you	O
look	O
up	O
from	O
the	O

Then	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
very	O
big	O
wych-elm	O

to	O
the	O

leaning	O

little	O
over	O
the	O
house	O

and	O
standing	O
on	O
the	O
boundary	O
between	O
the	O
garden	O
and	O
meadow	O

I	O
quite	O
love	O
that	O

Also	O
ordinary	O
elms	O

no	O
nastier	O

and	O
a	O

No	O
silver	O

though	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
must	O
get	O
on	O
to	O
my	O
host	O
and	O
hostess	O
.	O

I	O
only	O
wanted	O
to	O
show	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
n't	O
the	O
least	O
what	O
we	O
expected	O
.	O

Why	O
did	O
we	O
settle	O
that	O
their	O
house	O
would	O
be	O
all	O
gables	O
and	O
wiggles	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
garden	O
all	O
gamboge-coloured	O
paths	O
?	O

I	O
believe	O
simply	O
because	O
we	O
associate	O
them	O
with	O
expensive	O
hotels	O
--	O
Mrs.	O
Wilcox	O
trailing	O
in	O
beautiful	O
dresses	O
down	O
long	O
corridors	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Wilcox	O
bullying	O
porters	O
,	O
etc	O
.	O

We	O
females	O
are	O
that	O
unjust	O
.	O

I	O
shall	O
be	O
back	O
Saturday	O
;	O
will	O
let	O
you	O
know	O
train	O
later	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
as	O
angry	O
as	O
I	O
am	O
that	O
you	O
did	O
not	O
come	O
too	O
;	O
really	O
Tibby	O
is	O
too	O
tiresome	O
,	O
he	O
starts	O
a	O
new	O
mortal	O
disease	O
every	O
month	O
.	O

How	O
could	O
he	O
have	O
got	O
hay	O
fever	O
in	O
London	O
?	O

and	O
even	O
if	O
he	O
could	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
hard	O
that	O
you	O
should	O
give	O
up	O
a	O
visit	O
to	O
hear	O
a	O
schoolboy	O
sneeze	O
.	O

Tell	O
him	O
that	O
Charles	O
Wilcox	O
(	O
the	O
son	O
who	O
is	O
here	O
)	O
has	O
hay	O
fever	O
too	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
's	O
brave	O
,	O
and	O
gets	O
quite	O
cross	O
when	O
we	O
inquire	O
after	O
it	O
.	O

Men	O
like	O
the	O
Wilcoxes	O
would	O
do	O
Tibby	O
a	O
power	O
of	O
good	O
.	O

But	O
you	O
wo	O
n't	O
agree	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
'd	O
better	O
change	O
the	O
subject	O

This	O
long	O
letter	O
is	O
because	O
I	O
'm	O
writing	EVENT
before	O

Oh	O

the	O
beautiful	O

I	O
looked	EVENT
out	O
earlier	O
,	O
and	O
Mrs.	O
Wilcox	O
was	O
already	O
in	O
the	O
garden	O
.	O

She	O
evidently	O
loves	O
it	O
.	O

No	O
wonder	O
she	O
sometimes	O
looks	O
tired	O
.	O

She	O
was	O
watching	EVENT
the	O
large	O
red	O
poppies	O
come	EVENT
out	O

Then	O
she	O
walked	EVENT
off	O
the	O
lawn	O
to	O
the	O
meadow	O
,	O
whose	O
corner	O
to	O
the	O
right	O
I	O
can	O
just	O
see	EVENT

Trail	O
,	O
trail	O
,	O
went	EVENT
her	O
long	O
dress	O
over	O
the	O
sopping	O
grass	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
came	EVENT
back	O
with	O
her	O
hands	O
full	O
of	O
the	O
hay	O
that	O
was	O
cut	EVENT
yesterday	O
--	O
I	O
suppose	O
for	O
rabbits	O
or	O
something	O
,	O
as	O
she	O
kept	O
on	O
smelling	EVENT
it	O
.	O

The	O
air	O
here	O
is	O
delicious	O
.	O

Later	O
on	O
I	O
heard	EVENT
the	O
noise	EVENT
of	O
croquet	O
balls	O
,	O
and	O
looked	EVENT
out	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
Charles	O
Wilcox	O
practising	EVENT
;	O
they	O
are	O
keen	O
on	O
all	O
games	O
.	O

Presently	O
he	O
started	O
sneezing	EVENT
and	O
had	O
to	O
stop	EVENT
.	O

Then	O
I	O
hear	EVENT
more	O
clicketing	EVENT
,	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
Mr.	O
Wilcox	O
practising	EVENT
,	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
'	O
a-tissue	O
,	O
a-tissue	O
'	O
:	O
he	O
has	O
to	O
stop	EVENT
too	O
.	O

Then	O
Evie	O
comes	EVENT
out	O
,	O
and	O
does	O
some	O
calisthenic	O
exercises	EVENT
on	O
a	O
machine	O
that	O
is	O
tacked	O
on	O
to	O
a	O
greengage-tree	O
--	O
they	O
put	O
everything	O
to	O
use	O
--	O
and	O
then	O
she	O
says	EVENT
'	O
a-tissue	O
,	O
'	O
and	O
in	O
she	O
goes	EVENT
.	O

And	O
finally	O
Mrs.	O
Wilcox	O
reappears	EVENT
,	O
trail	O
,	O
trail	O
,	O
still	O
smelling	EVENT
hay	O
and	O
looking	EVENT
at	O
the	O
flowers	O
.	O

I	O
inflict	EVENT
all	O
this	O
on	O
you	O
because	O
once	O
you	O
said	EVENT
that	O
life	O
is	O
sometimes	O
life	O
and	O
sometimes	O
only	O
a	O
drama	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
must	O
learn	O
to	O
distinguish	O
t	O
'	O
other	O
from	O
which	O
,	O
and	O
up	O
to	O
now	O
I	O
have	O
always	O
put	O
that	O
down	O
as	O
'	O
Meg	O
's	O
clever	O
nonsense	O
.	O
'	O

But	O
this	O
morning	O
,	O
it	O
really	O
does	O
seem	O
not	O
life	O
but	O
a	O
play	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
did	O
amuse	EVENT
me	O
enormously	O
to	O
watch	EVENT
the	O
W	O
's	O
.	O

Now	O
Mrs.	O
Wilcox	O
has	O
come	EVENT
in	O

I	O
am	O
going	O
to	O
wear	O
[	O

Last	O

Mrs.	O

wore	O
an	O
[	O
omission	O

,	O
and	O
Evie	O
[	O

So	O
it	O
is	O
n't	O
exactly	O
a	O
go-as-you-please	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
you	O
shut	O
your	O
eyes	O
it	O
still	O
seems	O
the	O
wiggly	O
hotel	O
that	O
we	O
expected	O
.	O

Not	O
if	O
you	O
open	O
them	O
.	O

The	O
dog-roses	O
are	O
too	O
sweet	O

There	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
hedge	O
of	O
them	O
over	O
the	O
lawn	O

magnificently	O
tall	O

so	O
that	O
they	O

and	O
nice	O

thin	O
at	O

so	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
see	O
ducks	O

it	O

I	O
never	O
saw	O
anything	O
like	O
her	O

and	O
the	O
best	O
of	O

is	O
that	O
