It	O
was	O

the	O
clock	O

I	O
began	O

In	O
consideration	O
of	O
the	O
day	O

hour	O
of	O
my	O
birth	EVENT

it	O
was	O
declared	EVENT
by	O
the	O

by	O
some	O
sage	O

was	O
any	O
possibility	O
of	O

unlucky	O
in	O
life	O

that	O

I	O
need	O
say	O
nothing	O
here	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
first	O
head	O
,	O
because	O
nothing	O

On	O

I	O

that	O

Consequently	O
the	O

I	O
was	O

myself	O

I	O
remember	EVENT

The	O
caul	O
was	O
won	EVENT

I	O
recollect	EVENT

by	O
an	O
old	O

with	O
a	O

very	O

all	O
in	O
halfpence	O

and	O
twopence	O

it	O
took	O
an	O
immense	O

a	O
great	O
waste	O
of	O
arithmetic	O
,	O
to	O
endeavour	O
without	O
any	O
effect	O
to	O
prove	O
to	O
her	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
fact	O
which	O
will	O
be	O
long	O
remembered	O
as	O
remarkable	O
down	O
there	O
,	O
that	O
she	O

died	O
triumphantly	O
in	O

at	O
ninety-two	O

I	O
have	O
understood	O
that	O
it	O
was	O

to	O
the	O
last	O

that	O

It	O
was	O

that	O
some	O
