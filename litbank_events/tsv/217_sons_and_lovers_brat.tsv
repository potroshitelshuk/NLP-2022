that	O

Mrs.	O

was	O
not	O

when	O

But	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
best	O
she	O
could	O
do	O
.	O

Moreover	O
,	O
she	O
had	O
an	O
end	O
house	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
top	O
blocks	O
,	O
and	O
thus	O
had	O
only	O
one	O
neighbour	O
;	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
an	O
extra	O
strip	O
of	O

And	O
,	O
having	O
an	O
end	O
house	O

she	O
enjoyed	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
aristocracy	O
among	O
the	O
other	O
women	O
of	O
the	O
“	O

because	O
her	O
