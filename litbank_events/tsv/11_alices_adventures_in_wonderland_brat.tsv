CHAPTER	O

Down	O

Rabbit-Hole	O
Alice	O

very	O

her	O

on	O
the	O
bank	O

once	O

twice	O
she	O
had	O
peeped	EVENT
into	O
the	O
book	O

but	O
it	O
had	O
no	O

So	O
she	O
was	O
considering	EVENT
in	O
her	O
own	O
mind	O
(	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
she	O
could	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
hot	O
day	O
made	O
her	O
feel	O
very	O
sleepy	O
and	O
stupid	O
)	O
,	O
whether	O
the	O
pleasure	O
of	O
making	O
a	O
daisy-chain	O
would	O
be	O
worth	O
the	O
trouble	O
of	O
getting	O
up	O
and	O
picking	O
the	O
daisies	O
,	O
when	O
suddenly	O
a	O
White	O
Rabbit	O
with	O
pink	O
eyes	O
ran	EVENT
close	O
by	O
her	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
nothing	O
so	O
VERY	O
remarkable	O
in	O
that	O
;	O
nor	O
did	O
Alice	O
think	O
it	O
so	O
VERY	O
much	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
to	O
hear	EVENT
the	O
Rabbit	O
say	EVENT
to	O

‘	O
Oh	O

it	O
occurred	EVENT

her	O
that	O
she	O

at	O
the	O
time	O

seemed	O

when	O
the	O
Rabbit	O
actually	O
TOOK	EVENT
A	O
WATCH	O
OUT	O
OF	O
ITS	O
WAISTCOAT-POCKET	O
,	O
and	O
looked	EVENT
at	O
it	O

and	O
then	O
hurried	EVENT
on	O
,	O
Alice	O
started	EVENT
to	O
her	O
feet	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
flashed	EVENT
across	O
her	O
mind	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
never	O
before	O
seen	O
a	O
rabbit	O
with	O
either	O
a	O
waistcoat-pocket	O

or	O
a	O

to	O
take	O
out	O
of	O
it	O

and	O
burning	O
with	O
curiosity	O
,	O
she	O
ran	EVENT
across	O
the	O
field	O
after	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
fortunately	O
was	O
just	O
in	O
time	O
to	O
see	EVENT
it	O
pop	EVENT
down	O
a	O
large	O
rabbit-hole	O
under	O
the	O

In	O
another	O
moment	O
down	O
went	EVENT
Alice	O
after	O
it	O

never	O
once	O
considering	O
how	O

the	O

she	O
was	O
to	O

out	O
again	O

The	O
rabbit-hole	O
went	O
straight	O
on	O
like	O
a	O
tunnel	O
for	O
some	O
way	O

and	O
then	O
dipped	O
suddenly	O
down	O

so	O
suddenly	O
that	O
Alice	O
had	O
not	O

she	O

went	EVENT
down	O

what	O

she	O

but	O
it	O
was	O
too	O
dark	O
to	O

then	O
she	O
looked	EVENT
at	O
the	O
sides	O
of	O
the	O
