I	O
THERE	O
IS	O
NO	O
ONE	O
LEFT	O
When	O
Mary	O
Lennox	O
was	O
sent	EVENT
to	O
Misselthwaite	O
Manor	O
to	O
live	O
with	O
her	O
uncle	O
everybody	O
said	O
she	O
was	O
the	O
most	O
disagreeable-looking	O
child	O
ever	O
seen	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
true	O
,	O
too	O
.	O

She	O
had	O
a	O
little	O
thin	O
face	O
and	O
a	O
little	O
thin	O
body	O
,	O
thin	O
light	O
hair	O
and	O
a	O
sour	O
expression	O
.	O

Her	O
hair	O
was	O
yellow	O
,	O
and	O
her	O
face	O
was	O
yellow	O
because	O
she	O
had	O
been	O
born	EVENT
in	O
India	O
and	O
had	O
always	O
been	O
ill	O
in	O
one	O
way	O
or	O
another	O
.	O

Her	O
father	O
had	O
held	O
a	O
position	O
under	O
the	O
English	O
Government	O
and	O
had	O
always	O
been	O
busy	O
and	O
ill	O
himself	O
,	O
and	O
her	O
mother	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
great	O
beauty	O
who	O
cared	O
only	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
parties	O
and	O
amuse	O
herself	O
with	O
gay	O
people	O
.	O

She	O
had	O
not	O
wanted	O
a	O
little	O
girl	O
at	O
all	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
Mary	O
was	O
born	EVENT
she	O
handed	EVENT
her	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
care	O
of	O
an	O
Ayah	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
made	O
to	O
understand	O
that	O
if	O
she	O
wished	O
to	O
please	O
the	O
Mem	O
Sahib	O
she	O
must	O
keep	O
the	O
child	O
out	O
of	O
sight	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
possible	O
.	O

So	O
when	O
she	O
was	O
a	O
sickly	O
,	O
fretful	O
,	O
ugly	O
little	O
baby	O
she	O
was	O
kept	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
she	O
became	O
a	O
sickly	O
,	O
fretful	O
,	O
toddling	O
thing	O
she	O
was	O
kept	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
also	O
.	O

She	O
never	O
remembered	O
seeing	O
familiarly	O
anything	O
but	O
the	O
dark	O
faces	O
of	O
her	O
Ayah	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
native	O
servants	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
they	O
always	O
obeyed	O
her	O
and	O
gave	O
her	O
her	O
own	O
way	O
in	O
everything	O
,	O
because	O
the	O
Mem	O
Sahib	O
would	O
be	O
angry	O
if	O
she	O
was	O
disturbed	O
by	O
her	O
crying	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
time	O
she	O
was	O
six	O
years	O
old	O
she	O
was	O
as	O
tyrannical	O
and	O
selfish	O
a	O
little	O
pig	O
as	O
ever	O
lived	O

The	O
young	O
English	O
governess	O
who	O
came	O
to	O
teach	O
her	O
to	O
read	O
and	O
write	O
disliked	O
her	O
so	O
much	O
that	O
she	O
gave	O
up	O
her	O
place	O
in	O
three	O
months	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
other	O
governesses	O
came	O
to	O
try	O
to	O
fill	O
it	O
they	O
always	O
went	O
away	O
in	O
a	O
shorter	O
time	O
than	O
the	O
first	O
one	O
.	O

So	O
if	O
Mary	O
had	O
not	O
chosen	O
to	O
really	O
want	O
to	O
know	O
how	O
to	O
read	O

she	O

The	O
